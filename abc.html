Undoubtedly, my parents, Hughie and Evelyn Carroll, inadvertently
gave birth to this treatise by telling me not to waste my time and money
on horror books, magazines, comics, TV shows, and movies. In a final
act of filial defiance, I, a middle-aged baby-boomer, have set out to
prove to them that I was gainfully employed all along.
My thinking about horror really began to assemble itself when Annette
Michelson and I taught a course in horror and science fiction at New York
University. Annette soldiered the science fiction half of the course, while the
gooier parts of the terrain became my lot. Annette was, and has continued to
be, very helpful in the development of my theory. She suggested casting my
notions about horrific biologies in terms of fusion and fission, and, as well,
she has continually pressed me, with regard to my skepticism about
contemporary film theory, to take the paradox of fiction seriously. Though
my solutions to her questions may not be what she expected, I hope they are
at least intriguing.
Early on, two philosophers—both of them horror addicts—abetted me in
the conviction that pursuing this topic could be interesting. Judith Tormey
and I spent an exhilarating drive to Mexico together, boring everyone else in
the car while we swapped favorite monster stories. Jeff Blustein read my
earliest attempts in horror theory with the analytical rigor and the
enthusiasm only a fellow horror buff can appreciate.
The late Monroe Beardsley also read my nascent efforts at horror theory.
He wondered aloud how I could be interested in this stuff. But then he
addressed my hypotheses with what could only be thought of as arcane
counterexamples. Sheepishly, he explained his estimable expertise in the field
by saying that he had had to squire his sons through the fifties horror movie
cycle, and that he just happened to remember some of the films (in amazing
detail, I would add).
My interest in horror gradually turned into academic papers, delivered at
the University of Southern California, the University of Warwick, the
x / Acknowledgments
Museum of the Moving Image, LeMoyne College, Cornell University, New
York University, and the University of Iowa. Each audience provided
challenging comments—of special note are those of: Stanley Cavell, Ed
Leites, Karen Hansen, Richard Koszarski, Johnny Buchsbaum, Stuart
Liebman, Allan Casebier, Jim Manley, Bruce Wilshire, Susan Bordo, the late
Irving Thalberg Jr., Stephen Melville, Mary Wiseman, Ken Olsen, Nick
Sturgeon, Anthony Appiah, David Bathrick, Cynthia Baughman, Murray
Smith, Dudley Andrew, Henry Jenkins, Kristin Thompson, Berenice
Reynaud, and Julian Hochberg.
Much of the initial writing of this book began during a sabbatical at
Wesleyan University. Early discussions with Kent Bendall—one of the most
precise and yet imaginatively open philosophers it has been my privilege to
know—gave me important clues for solving what I call the paradox of
fiction. Long talks with Chris Gauker, over several extremely pleasant
dinners, helped me clarify my position. Ken Taylor and especially Philip
Hallie, whose pioneering work on the philosophy of horror in his book The
Paradox Cruelty served as an exemplar, listened to my theories with a critical
attentiveness that was generous, and always supportive and instructive. Phil
was even willing to go to a number of movies with me and to discuss them
afterwards (something only someone who works on the genre of horror can
realize is a gesture of unstinting companionship).
Michael Denning, Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse provided
many useful suggestions about correspondences between my research and
contemporary literary studies. Betsy Traube, transcending her aversion to
my topic, made many pertinent recommendations about relevant
anthropological literature. Khachig Tololyan who, among his many
accomplishments, runs one of the world’s great clipping services, kept me
constantly on top of my subject. And Jay Wallace, who read drafts of the first
two chapters with immense care, supplied me with copious criticisms and
suggestions. On more than one occasion, Jay showed me how I could modify
my claims judiciously and still make my points. Both his unalloyed interest
and his arguments have made significant differences in this book. It was
wonderful to have been his colleague.
Francis Dauer, Annette Barnes, John Fisher, Dale Jamieson, George
Wilson, Arthur Danto, George Dickie, John Morreall, Richard Moran, Terry
Irwin, Laurent Stern, Paul Guyer, Alex Sesonske, Daniel Banes, Jennefer
Robinson, Susan Feagin, Gary Iseminger, Roy Gordon, and Myles Brand
listened to, or read my hypotheses, and made comments which I found
important to consider. Joe Margolis, across a number of conversations,
showed me the need to make several distinctions I had ignored, as well as
pointing me toward some authors of whose work I had been uninformed.
Richard Shusterman, after reading my essay “The Nature of Horror,”
Acknowledgments / xi
alerted me to Peter Lemarque’s seminal and more advanced writings on the
very type of theory of fictional objects that I was attempting to develop.
Tony Pipolo and Amy Taubin, both of whom see and read everything,
gave me “front-line” reports on every novel, film and video that I hoped to
accommodate in my theory. If their sensibilities outstrip my formulas, I hope
they can nevertheless see some of their sensitivities worked into my
descriptions.
David Bordwell, David Konstan, and Peter Kivy read the entire
manuscript. Each made provocative criticisms and useful suggestions. David
Bordwell showed me how I needed to clarify the distinction between my
theory and reigning psychoanalytic models in the humanities today, as well
as correcting some (there weren’t that many) of my film-historical errors.
David Konstan made sentence-by-sentence remarks, many of which I have
incorporated; those I have bypassed, I suspect, I have so done at my own
peril. Peter Kivy not only copy-edited the manuscript, but made many
penetrating philosophical comments about the content. However, above all,
it is to Peter that I owe, due to his work in the philosophy of music, the
insight of the applicability, in general, of the theory of the emotions to
questions in the philosophy of art.
Special thanks are due to William Germano who, it can be said, first had
the thought that such a book could be written. In the course of a
conversation on other matters, he indicated that he would “love” (his word)
a proposal for a book on the philosophy of horror from me. I would not have
thought of it otherwise. The rest is history (destiny?).
I have dedicated this book to my wife, Sally Banes. She courageously
accompanied me on my many forays to cinemas and theaters all over the
world for the sake of my “research.” She patiently waited while I perused
innumerable bookstalls any time we went to a grocery store, a pharmacy, or
a department store outlet. Her own work on the fairy tale also afforded me
an extremely useful complement to my theorizing about horror. Sally has
read every draft of this project and provided endless comment: grammatical
and logical; stylistic and conceptual. If such a book is a labor of love, it is also
a labor of lovers. And I have been blessed with a lover willing to make my
project her own.
So many smart and talented people have told me so much. If there are
flaws remaining in this text, it only shows that I’m a bad listener.

Introduction
Context
For over a decade and a half, perhaps especially in the United States,
horror has flourished as a major source of mass aesthetic stimulation.
Indeed, it may even be the most long-lived, widely disseminated, and
persistent genre of the post-Vietnam era. Horror novels seem available
in virtually every supermarket and pharmacy, and new titles appear with
unsettling rapidity. The onslaught of horror novels and anthologies, at
present at least, is as unstoppable and as inescapable as the monsters
they portray. One author in this genre, Stephen King, has become a
household name, while others, like Peter Straub and Clive Barker,
though somewhat less known, also command large followings.
Popular movies, as well, have remained so obsessed with horror since the
box office triumph of The Exorcist that it is difficult to visit your local
multiplex theater without meeting at least one monster. The evidence of the
immense output of horror movies in the last decade and a half is also readily
confirmed by a quick estimate of the proportion of the space in the
neighborhood video store that is turned over to horror rentals.
Horror and music explicitly join forces in rock videos, notably Michael
Jackson’s Thriller, though one must also remember that the iconography of
horror supplies a pervasive coloration to much of MTV and the pop music
industry. The Broadway musical smash of 1988, of course, was Phantom of
the Opera, which had already seen success in London, and which inspired
such unlikely fellow travelers as Carrie. On the dramatic side of theater, new
versions of horror classics have appeared, such as Edward Gorey’s variations
on Dracula, while TV has launched a number of horror or horror-related
series such as Freddy’s Nightmares. Horror figures even in fine art, not only
directly, in works by Francis Bacon, H.R.Giger, and Sibylle Ruppert, but
artists. In short, horror has become a staple across contemporary art forms,
2 / Introduction
also in the form of allusions in the pastiches of a number of postmodern
popular and otherwise, spawning vampires, trolls, gremlins, zombies, were
wolves, demonically possessed children, space monsters of all sizes, ghosts,
and other unnameable concoctions at a pace that has made the last decade or
so seem like one long Halloween night.
In 1982, Stephen King speculated—as many of us do at the end of every
summer—that the present horror cycle looked as though it were coming to
an end.1
 But, as of the writing of this introduction, Freddy—in his fourth,
lucrative reincarnation—is still terrorizing the scions of Elm Street, and a
new collection by Clive Barker, entitled Cabal, has just arrived in the mail.
At first, the present horror cycle gained momentum slowly. On the literary
side, it was presaged by the appearance of Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby (1967)
and Fred Mustard Stewart’s The Mephisto Waltz (1969) which prepared the
way for best-selling entries like Tom Tryon’s The Other (1971) and William
Peter Blatty’s blockbuster The Exorcist (also 1971).2
 The mass reading market
that was secured, especially by The Exorcist, was then consolidated by the
appearance of such books as Ira Levin’s The Stepford Wives (1972), Stephen
King’s first published novel, Carrie (1973), Robert Marasco’s Burnt Offerings
(1973), Jeffrey Konvitz’s The Sentinel (1974), and King’s Salem’s Lot (1975).
Of course, horror literature—by masters such as Richard Matheson, Dennis
Wheatley, John Wyndham, and Robert Bloch—was continuously available
prior to the appearance of these books. But what seems to have happened in
the first half of the seventies is that horror, so to speak, entered the
mainstream. Its audience was no longer specialized, but widened, and horror
novels became increasingly easy to come by. This, in turn, augmented the
audience looking for horror entertainments and, by the late seventies and
eighties, a phalanx of authors arose to satisfy that demand, including: Charles
L.Grant, Dennis Etchison, Ramsey Campbell, Alan Ryan, Whitely Strieber,
James Herbert, T.E.D.Klein, John Coyne, Anne Rice, Michael McDowell,
Dean Koontz, John Saul and many others.
As the reader will undoubtedly recognize immmediately, the novels listed
above were all made into movies, often very successful movies. Most
important in this respect, it almost goes without saying, was The Exorcist,
directed by William Friedkin and released in 1973. The success of this film,
one speculates, not only acted as a stimulant to movie production but also
made horror more attractive to publishers. For many who were horrified by
the film, in consequence, sought out the novel, thereby acquiring a taste for
horror literature. The relation between the horror film and horror literature
has been quite intimate during the current horror cycle—both in the obvious
sense that often horror films are adapted from horror novels, and in the sense
that many of the writers in the genre were deeply influenced by earlier horror
movie cycles—to which they refer not only in interviews but within the texts
of their novels as well.3
Introduction / 3
Of course, the immense influence on the film industry of The Exorcist’s
success is even more evident than its impact on the literary marketplace. As
well as putting in place the recurring themes of possession and telekinesis,
The Exorcist (the movie) was immediately followed by a slew of copycats,
including Abby, Beyond the Door, La Endemoniada (a.k.a. Demon Witch
Child), Exorcismo, and The Devil’s Rain. At first it looked as though the
genre would dissipate in the flood of lackluster imitations. But in 1975, Jaws
rocked the movie market, reassuring filmmakers that there was still gold left
to be mined in horror. When the reaction to Jaws (and its derivatives) seemed
to flag, along came Carrie and The Omen. And then, in 1977, Star Wars,
although not a horror film, opened the door to outer space, thereby
eventually admitting the likes of Alien. Each time the health of the genre
seemed threatened, suddenly it would revive. The genre seems immensely
resilient. This indicates that at present the fantasy genres, of which horror is
a leading example, are continually worth trying when producers think about
what to make next. The result has been a truly staggering number of horror
titles. And, as well, we now have before us a generation of accomplished film
directors many of whom are recognized specialists in the horror/fantasy film,
including: Steven Spielberg, David Cronenberg, Brian De Palma, David
Lynch, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Philip Kaufman, Tobe Hooper, John
McTiernan, Ridley Scott, and others.
In emphasizing the large numbers of horror films produced in the last
decade and a half, I do not mean to imply that horror films were not
accessible in the sixties. However, such films were somewhat marginal; one
had to stay on the lookout for the latest offerings of American International
Pictures, William Castle, and Hammer Films. Roger Corman, though
beloved of horror connoisseurs, was not a figure of wide repute; and latenight
classics like George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead enjoyed
primarily an underground reputation. The series of blockbusters, starting
with The Exorcist, changed the position of the horror film in the culture,
and, I would submit, also encouraged the expansion of the publication and
consumption of horror literature.
Of course, the markets for horror literature and film did not spring from
nowhere. The audience, one would imagine, comprised primarily
babyboomers. These audiences, like a large number of the artists who came to
specialize in horror, were the first post-war generation raised by TV. And one
would hypothesize that their affection for horror, to a large extent, was
nurtured and deepened by the endless reruns of the earlier horror and sci-fi
cycles that provided the repertoire of the afternoon and late-night television of
their youth. This generation has, in turn, raised the next on a diet of horror
entertainments whose imagery suffuses the culture—from breakfast cereals
and children’s toys to postmodern art—and which supply an impressive
proportion of the literary, cinematic and even theatrical output of our society.
4 / Introduction
It is within this context that the time seems especially propitious to initiate
an aesthetic inquiry into the nature of horror. The purpose of this book is to
investigate the horror genre philosophically. But though this project is
undeniably prompted and made urgent by the ubiquitousness of horror
today, insofar as its task is philosophical it will attempt to come to terms
with general features of the genre as manifested throughout its history.
A Brief Overview of the Horror Genre
The object of this treatise is the horror genre. However, before
developing my theory of that genre, it will be helpful to provide a rough
historical sketch of the phenomenon I intend to discuss. Following the
lead of many commentators on horror, I will presume that horror is, first
and foremost, a modern genre, one that begins to appear in the
eighteenth century.4 The immediate source of the horror genre was the
English Gothic novel, the German Schauer-roman, and French roman
noir. The general, though perhaps arguable, consensus is that the
inaugural Gothic novel of relevance to the horror genre was Horace
Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto in 1765. This novel carried on the
resistance to neo-classical taste initiated by the preceding generation of
graveyard poets.5
The rubric Gothic encompasses a lot of territory. Following the fourfold
classificatory scheme suggested by Montague Summers, we can see that it
subsumes the historical gothic, the natural or explained gothic, the
supernatural gothic and the equivocal gothic.6 The historical gothic
represents a tale set in the imagined past without the suggestion of
supernatural events, while the natural gothic introduces what appear to be
supernatural phenomena only to explain them away. Ann Radcliffe’s
Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) is a classic of this category. The equivocal
gothic, such as Charles Brockden Brown’s Edgar Huntley: or, the Memoirs
of a Sleepwalker (1799), renders the supernatural origin of events in the text
ambiguous by means of psychologically disturbed characters. The explained
gothic and the equivocal gothic presage what nowadays are often called the
uncanny and the fantastic by literary theorists.
Of greatest importance for the evolution of the horror genre proper was
the supernatural gothic, in which the existence and cruel operation of
unnatural forces are asserted graphically. Of this variation, J.M.S.Tompkins
writes that “the authors work by sudden shocks, and when they deal with
the supernatural, their favorite effect is to wrench the mind suddenly from
skepticism to horror struck belief.”7
 The appearance of the demon and the
gruesome impalement of the priest at the end of Matthew Lewis’s The Monk
(1797) is the real harbinger of the horror genre. Other major achievements in
this period of the development in the genre include: Mary Shelley’s
Introduction / 5
Frankenstein (1818), John Polidori’s The Vampyre (1819), and Charles
Robert Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer (1820).
Already by the 1820s, horror stories began to provide the basis for
dramatizations. In 1823, Frankenstein was adapted for the stage by Richard
Brinsely Peake under the title of Presumption: or, the Fate of Frankenstein
(a.k.a. Frankenstein: or, the Danger of Presumption or Frankenstein: A
Romantic Drama). Thomas Potter Cooke played the monster as well as
playing Lord Ruthven in adaptations of Polidori’s The Vampyre. On
occasion, adaptations of the two stories would be presented as double bills,
perhaps calling to mind the way in which the two myths function to kick off
both the horror movie cycle of the thirties and the golden age of Hammer
Films. Alternative versions of the Frankenstein story were popular in the
1820s, including Le Monstre et le Magicien, Frankenstein: or, The Man and
the Monster, as well as numerous satirical deviations that inadvertently
herald the shenanigans of Abbott and Costello.8 The ballet stage also
explored horrific themes in the divertissement of the dead nuns in Giacomo
Meyerbeer’s opera Robert le Diable (Filippo Taglioni, 1831), and in such
ballets as La Sylphide (Filippo Taglioni, 1832), Les Ondines (Louis Henry,
1834) Giselle (Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, 1841), and Napoli (August
Bournonville, 1844).
Horror continued to be written during the period between the 1820s and
the 1870s, but it was eclipsed in importance in the culture of the
Englishspeaking world largely by the emergence of the realist novel. From
the 1820s to the 1840s, Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine kept the gothic

fires burning by publishing short fictions by William Mudford, Edward
Bulwer-Lytton, and James Hogg, while in the later 1840s, the popular
imagination was gripped by Varney the Vampire: or, The Feast of Blood, a
serial novel in 220 chapters by Thomas Prest,9
 and Wagner, the Wehr-wolf by
George William MacArthur. In America, Edgar Allen Poe followed the lead
of Blackwood and, in fact, wrote a piece entitled “How to Write a
Blackwood Article.”10
Generalizing about his period, Benjamin Franklin Fisher writes:
The significant trend in horror tales of this period mirrored developments
in the greater Victorian and American novels then emerging into a solidly
artistic and serious genre. There was a shift from physical fright,
expressed through numerous outward miseries and villainous actions to
psychological fear. The inward turn in fiction emphasized motivations,
not their overt terrifying consequences. The ghost-in-a-bedsheet gave way,
as it did literally in Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, to the haunted
psyche, a far more significant force in the “spooking” of hapless victims.11
Along with Poe’s work, Fisher would appear to have in mind here the
gothic atmospherics in the works of Hawthorne, Melville, and the
6 / Introduction
Brontes. However, the figure of the period who may have made the
greatest direct contribution to the horror genre proper might be Joseph
Sheridan Le Fanu, who in his stories frequently placed the supernatural
amidst the world of everyday life, where the persecution of ordinary,
innocent victims, (rather than gothic overreachers) was closely observed
and received the kind of psychological elaboration that would set the
tone for much of the ensuing work in the genre.
Le Fanu’s In a Glass Darkly (1872) ushered in a period, that lasted into the
1920s, of major accomplishment in the ghost story. Masterpieces in this form,
generally in a short-story format, flowed from the pens of Henry James, Edith
Wharton, Rudyard Kipling, Ambrose Bierce, Guy de Maupassant, Arthur
Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Oliver Onions, and others.
Classic novels of horror—later adapted and readapted for stage and
screen—were produced in this time span, including: Robert Louis
Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1887), Oscar
Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Grey (1891) and Bram Stoker’s Dracula
(1897). H.G.Wells, usually associated with science fiction, also produced
horror and ghost stories from the turn of the century onwards. And other
esteemed, though less well-known, horror authors of this fecund period
were: Grant Allen, Mrs. Riddell, M.P.Shiel, G.S.Viereck, Eliot O’Donnell,
R.W.Chambers, E.F.Benson, Mrs. Campbell Prael, and William Clark
Russell.
According to Gary William Crawford, in contrast to the cosmic strain in
the works of masters of the preceding generation (like Blackwood, Machen,
and Onions), the English horror story after World War I took a realist and
psychological turn in the work of Walter De La Mare, L.P.Hartley, W.F.
Harvey, R.H.Malden, A.N.L.Munby, L.T.C.Rolt, M.P.Dare, H.Russell
Wakefield, Elizabeth Bowen, Mary Sinclair, and Cynthia Asquith.12
However, the cosmic wing of horror writing was kept alive in America by
Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890–1937), who stood at the center of the
writers working for the pulp periodical Weird Tales. Lovecraft was a
prodigious writer, churning out not only reams of stories, but also a treatise
entitled Supernatural Horror in Literature and a vast correspondence
through which he advanced his particular aesthetic of horror. Partly due to
this correspondence and to his support of aspiring writers, Lovecraft enlisted
a loyal following of authors and imitators, such as Clark Ashton Smith, Carl
Jacobi, and August Derleth. Robert Bloch also began his career in the
Lovecraft tradition of cosmic horror which continued to influence the genre
until long after World War II.13
After World War I, the horror genre also found a new home in the nascent
art of the cinema. Horror films in the style that has come to be known as
German Expressionism were made in Weimar Germany and some, like
F.W.Murnau’s Nosferatu, have become recognized horror masterpieces.
Introduction / 7
Prior to the current horror movie cycle, the history of film witnessed several
other major spurts of creativity in the horror mode: an early thirties cycle,
which was started by Universal Studios and which movie makers attempted
to resuscitate in the late thirties and early forties with an eye to younger
audiences; the spate of adult horror films produced in the forties by Val
Lewton at RKO; the horror/sci-fi cycle of the early fifties, which inspired the
Japanese Godzilla industry of the mid-fifties, as well as an attempt to revive
the cycle in America again in the latter part of the decade.
These films, seen either in theaters or on TV, tutored a baby-boom
audience in a taste for horror, which in the sixties could be sustained by
marginal matinees of the output of AIP, William Castle, and Hammer
Films.14 The classic horror film myths often sent horror-hungry adepts to
their literary sources, as well as to less elevated reading material such as
Famous Monsters of Filmland (founded in 1958). And the products of
“fantastic” television, like The Twilight Zone, encouraged an interest in
writers such as Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, Roald Dahl, and the
short-story tradition from which they sprang. Thus, by the early seventies,
an audience was ready for the next—i.e., the present—horror cycle.
This rough history of the horror genre circumscribes broadly the body of
work about which the present treatise attempts to theorize. My thumbnail
sketch of the genre earmarks, I think, what many would be disposed
pretheoretically to include in the genre. In the course of theorizing about the
genre, some of the works in this more or less naive view of the history of
horror will have to be reclassified. Several of the works mentioned above will
drop out of the genre when the genre is subjected to theoretical
regimentation. However, I think that the philosophy of horror evolved in the
course of this book will, in the main, characterize most of what people are
disposed pretheoretically to call horror; if it cannot, the theory is flawed.
That is, though I don’t expect to capture every item in the preceding canned
survey of the genre, if my theory misses too many of them, it is off the mark.
A Philosophy of Horror?
This book announces itself to be a philosophy of horror. The very
concept may perplex many. Who ever heard of a philosophy of horror? It
is not the sort of listing that one finds in a college bulletin or in the
publicity catalogues of academic presses. What in the world could one
intend by the strange phrase: “a philosophy of horror”?
Aristotle opens the first book of his Poetics with these words: “My design
is to treat of poetry in general and of its several species; to inquire what is the
proper effect of each—what construction of a fable, or plan, is essential to a
good poem—of what, and how many, parts each species consists; with
whatever else belongs to the same subject matter….”15 Aristotle does not
8 / Introduction
fully realize this outline in the text that survives. But he does offer us a
comprehensive account of tragedy in terms of the effect it is supposed to
bring about—the catharsis of pity and fear—with respect to the elements,
particularly the plot elements, that facilitate this effect: that tragic plots have
beginnings, middles, and ends in the technical sense that Aristotle applies
those notions, and that they have reversals, recognitions, and calamities.
Aristotle isolates the relevant plot elements in tragedy, that is, with attention
to the way in which they are designed to cause the emotional response whose
provocation Aristotle identifies as the quiddity of the genre.
Taking Aristotle to propose a paradigm of what the philosophy of an
artistic genre might be, I will offer an account of horror in virtue of the
emotional effects it is designed to cause in audiences. This will involve both
the characterization of the nature of that emotional effect and a review and
an analysis of the recurring figures and plot structures employed by the genre
to raise the emotional effects that are appropriate to it. That is, in the spirit
of Aristotle, I will presume that the genre is designed to produce an
emotional effect; I will attempt to isolate that effect; and I will attempt to
show how the characteristic structures, imagery, and figures in the genre are
arranged to cause the emotion that I will call art-horror. (Though I do not
expect to be as authoritative as Aristotle, it is my intention to try to do for
the horror genre what Aristotle did for tragedy.)
A philosophical dimension of the present treatise not found in Aristotle’s
work is my concentration on certain puzzles that pertain to the genre—what
I call (in my subtitle), stealing a phrase from certain eighteenth-century
writers, “paradoxes of the heart.” With respect to horror, these paradoxes
can be summed up in the following two questions: 1) how can anyone be
frightened by what they know does not exist, and 2) why would anyone ever
be interested in horror, since being horrified is so unpleasant? In the course of
the text, I will attempt to show what is at stake in posing these questions.
And, I will also advance philosophical theories which I hope will vaporize
these paradoxes.
The style of philosophy employed in this book is what is often called
Anglo-American or analytic philosophy. However, a word of warning is
useful here. For although I think it is accurate to say that this book is written
in the tradition of analytic philosophy, it is important to note that my
method is not exclusively a matter of what is sometimes called conceptual
analysis. For a number of reasons, I, like many other philosophers of my
generation, distrust the strict division between conceptual analysis and
empirical findings. Thus, in this book, there is conceptual analysis
interwoven with empirical hypotheses. That is, there is a mix of philosophy,
construed narrowly as conceptual analysis, and what might be called the
theory of horror, i.e., very general, empirical conjectures about recurring
patterns in the genre. Or, to put it yet another way, this philosophy of horror,
Introduction / 9
like Aristotle’s philosophy of tragedy, contains both conceptual analysis and
very general, empirically grounded hypotheses.
I have already claimed Aristotle as a precedent. My project could also be
likened to those of eighteenth century theoreticians, like Hutcheson and
Burke, who sought to define such things as the beautiful and the sublime,
and who wished to isolate the causal triggers that gave rise to these feelings.
And in the very early twentieth century, Bergson attempted a similar
investigation with respect to comedy.
All of these references, however, including the implicit functionalism that
I share with all these authors, undoubtedly makes the present project sound
exceedingly old-fashioned. So here it is important to emphasize the ways in
which the present study offers new approaches to philosophical aesthetics.
Philosophical aesthetics in the English speaking world has come to be
preoccupied with two central problems: what is art and what is the
aesthetic? These questions are good questions, and they have been addressed
with admirable sophistication and rigor. However, they are not the only
questions that philosophers of art can ask about their domain, and the
obsession with answering them has unduly constrained the ambit of
concern of contemporary aesthetic philosophers. Questions about art and
the aesthetic should not be abandoned; but more questions, whose answers
may even suggest new angles on the issues of art and the aesthetic, are
advisable, lest the field become a rut.
Recently, philosophers of art have wanted to alleviate the overly
constricted configuration of the field by looking at the special theoretical
problems of individual arts, by returning to older questions of the aesthetics
of nature, and by re-situating traditional questions about art within broader
questions about the function of symbol systems in general. The present
attempt at a philosophy of horror is part of this effort to widen the purview
of philosophical aesthetics. Not only should the special problems of artforms
be reconsidered; but the special problems of genres that cross artforms
should be re-evaluated as well.
One of the most interesting attempts to broaden the perspective of
philosophical aesthetics in recent years has been the emerging study of art in
relation to the emotions, a research project that unites the philosophy of art
with the philosophy of mind. One way to read the present text is to regard it
as a detailed case study in this larger enterprise.
Moreover, philosophical aesthetics tends to track what might be thought
of as high art. It is either oblivious to or suspicious of mass or popular art.
One reason for this is that mass and popular art gravitate toward the
formulaic, and aestheticians often presume a Kantian-inspired bias that art,
properly so called, is not susceptible to formula. The present treatise offends
this view doubly: 1) in considering mass art as worthy of the attention of
philosophical aesthetics, and 2) in not being cowed into agreeing that the
10 / Introduction
realm of art lacks formulas. Offending against both these views
simultaneously is obviously interconnected, and intentional.
This book is divided into four chapters. The first chapter proposes an
account of the nature of horror, specifically with respect to the emotion, art
horror, that the genre is designed to engender. This chapter not only offers a
definition of horror, which it attempts to defend against predictable
objections. It also tries to isolate recurring structures that give rise to the
emotion of art-horror, along with a historical conjecture about why the
genre emerged when it did.
The second chapter introduces the first of our paradoxes of the heart—
namely, the paradox of fiction. Applied to the horror genre, this is the
question of how we can be frightened by that which we know does not exist.
But the problem, here, is more general. For those who believe that we can
only be emotionally moved by what we know is the case, it is not only a
mystery as to why we are frightened by Count Dracula but also why we are
angered by Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone. This is the most technical chapter
in the book; those who have no liking for philosophical dialectics may wish
to merely skim it, if not skip it altogether.
The third chapter is a review of the most characteristically recurrent plots
in the genre, including extensive discussion of interrelated plot formations
such as suspense and what contemporary literary critics call the fantastic.
This is the most empirically developed part of the book; those who are
interested primarily in philosophical dialectics may wish to skim it, if not
skip it altogether.
The last chapter deals with our second paradox of the heart—indeed, the
paradox for which the writers John Aikin and his sister Anna Laetitia Aikin
(Barbauld) originally coined this lovely phrase in the eighteenth century. It is
the question of why, if horror is as it is described in the earlier chapters,
anyone would subject themselves to it. Call this the paradox of horror.
Normally, we shun what causes distress; most of us don’t play in traffic to
entertain ourselves, nor do we attend autopsies to while away the hours. So
why do we subject ourselves to fictions that will horrify us? It is a paradox of
the heart, one I hope to accommodate in concluding this treatise.
Moreover, after resolving this paradox, I hope to say why the horror genre
is as compelling nowadays as it is. This part of the book is not part of the
philosophy of horror proper. But, on the other hand, we would probably
never have noticed that a philosophy of horror was worth contemplating
had we not been engulfed by the genre in its contemporary form.
I have referred to this book as a treatise for its parts are systematically
related. The account that I offer of the nature of horror is fleshed out by an
investigation of horrific plotting and its related formations. Likewise, my
accounts of the nature of horror and of horror narration are material, in
different yet concerted ways, to the answer I give to what was called the
Introduction / 11
paradox of horror in the preceding paragraph. Moreover, the theory I
champion in the second chapter of the book, called the thought theory of our
response to fiction, pertains to my hypotheses about the paradox of horror,
because it offers an operational construction of what authors grope at with
notions like “aesthetic distance.” Thus, the parts of the book are
interconnected. However, no pretension is made in the direction of claiming
that this is an exhaustive account of the genre. There are many more topics
for future research that I have left untouched.
In some ways this book is very different from what has preceded it. The
usual approach to characterizing the horror genre—from H.P.Lovecraft to
Stephen King, by way of numerous academic critics—is to offer a series of
very general ruminations about horror in chapter one, and then to detail the
evolution of the genre historically through the examination of examples.
There is nothing wrong with that approach. But I have attempted to reverse
it, by initially suggesting a narrative of the form in the expectation that an
organon can be developed to comprehend it.
Despite all the peregrination and animadversion called for by introductions
to and executions of academic exercises of this sort, I have had a hell of a good
time writing this book, and I hope some of that rubs off on the reader.

The Nature of Horror
The Definition of Horror
Preliminaries
The purpose of this book is to develop a theory of horror, which is
conceived to be a genre that crosses numerous artforms and media. The
type of horror to be explored here is that associated with reading
something like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Algernon Blackwood’s
“Ancient Sorceries,” Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror,” Stephen
King’s Pet Sematary, or Clive Barker’s Damnation Game; and it is also
associated with seeing something like the Hamilton Deane and John
Balderston stage version of Dracula, movies such as James Whale’s
Bride of Frankenstein, Ridley Scott’s Alien, and George Romero’s Dawn
of the Dead, ballets like Michael Uthoff s version of Coppelia, and
operas/musicals like Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Phantom of the Opera.
The relevant sort of horror can also be found in fine art, as in the work
of Goya or H.R.Giger, in radio programs such as the Inner Sanctum and
Suspense of yesteryear, and in TV series like Night Stalker, or Tales from
the Darkside. We shall call this “art-horror.” Generally when the word
“horror” is used in what follows, it should be understood as art-horror.
This kind of horror is different from the sort that one expresses in saying
“I am horrified by the prospect of ecological disaster,” or “Brinksmanship in
the age of nuclear arms is horrifying,” or “What the Nazis did was horrible.”
Call the latter usage of “horror,” natural horror. It is not the task of this book
to analyze natural horror, but only art-horror, that is, “horror” as it serves to
name a cross-art, cross-media genre whose existence is already recognized in
ordinary language. This is the sense of the term “horror” that occurs when,
for example, in answer to the question “What kind of book is The Shining?,”
we say a horror story; or when we find programs are advertised in the TV
The Definition of Horror / 13
Guide as “halloween horror shows” or when the blurb on Diana Henstell’s
New Morning Dragon proclaims it to be “The chilling new novel of horror.”
“Horror,” as a category of ordinary language, is a serviceable concept
through which we communicate and receive information. It is not an obscure
notion. We manage to use it with a great deal of consensus; note how rarely
one has cause to dispute the sorting of items under the rubric of horror in
your local video store. The first part of this chapter can be construed as an
attempt to rationally reconstruct the latent criteria for identifying horror (in
the sense of art-horror) that are already operative in ordinary language.
In order to avoid misunderstanding, it is necessary to emphasize not only
the contrast with natural horror but also to stress that I am referring
narrowly to the effects of a specific genre. Thus, not all that might be called
horror that appears in art is art-horror. For example, one might be horrified
by the murder in Camus’s The Stranger or the sexual degradation in de
Sade’s The 120 Days of Sodom. Nevertheless, though such horror is
generated by art, it is not part of the phenomenon I am calling “art-horror.”1
Nor shall it refer to the frequent response of people of limited experience to
much avantgarde art.
“Art-horror,” by stipulation, is meant to refer to the product of a genre
that crystallized, speaking very roughly, around the time of the publication
of Frankenstein—give or take fifty years—and that has persisted, often
cyclically, through the novels and plays of the nineteenth century and the
literature, comic books, pulp magazines, and films of the twentieth. This
genre, moreover, is recognized in common speech and my theory of it must
ultimately be assessed in terms of the way in which it tracks ordinary usage.
Of course, horrific imagery can be found across the ages. In the ancient
Western world, examples include the story of the werewolf in Petronius’
Satyricon, of Lycaon and Jupiter in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and of
Aristomenes and Socrates in Apuleius’ The Golden Ass. Medieval danses
macabres, and characterizations of Hell such as the Vision of St. Paul, the
Vision of Tundale, Cranach the Elder’s Last Judgment, and, most famously,
Dante’s Inferno also feature examples of figures and incidents that will
become important to the horror genre. However, the genre itself only begins
to coalesce between the last half of the eighteenth century and the first
quarter of the nineteenth as a variation on the Gothic form in England and
related developments in Germany.2 (The reason for this particular
periodization of the genre will, I believe, become clearer as my exploration of
the nature of the genre progresses, and an explanation of why horror waits
to be born until the eighteenth century will be attempted in the concluding
section of this chapter.3
)
Moreover, it must also be noted that though my emphasis is on genre, I
shall not respect the notion that horror and science fiction are absolutely
discrete genres. The putative distinction here is often advanced by
14 / The Nature of Horror
connoisseurs of science fiction at the expense of horror. For them, science
fiction explores grand themes like alternate societies or alternate
technologies whereas the horror genre is really only a matter of scarefying
monsters. Defenders of science fiction, for example, are wont to say that
what generally passes for science fiction in movies is really merely horror—a
series of exercises in the art of the bug-eyed monster such as This Island
Earth, Invaders from Mars (both versions), and Alien Predators.4
That monsters are a mark of horror is a useful insight. However, it will
not do the work to which aficionados of science fiction delegate it. Even in
the case of movies, there are cases, such as Things to Come, that meet the
supposed standards of true science fiction. But, more importantly, the
defenders of science fiction protest too much. Not all of what we are prone
to call science fiction is preoccupied with high thoughts about alternate
technologies and societies. The late John Wyndham’s The Midwich
Cuckoos, The Kraken Wakes, The Day of the Triffids, and Web all seem to
be straightforwardly science fiction on any unprejudiced view, though
interest in them centers on monsters. Of course, the science fiction pundit
doesn’t deny that there are monsters in science fiction, but only that they
play second fiddle to the imagination of alternate technologies and/or
societies. But this seems to fly in the face of the facts—not only in the case of
Wyndham, but also those of H.G.Wells’s The War of the Worlds and Brian
Aldiss’s, Nebula award-winning The Saliva Tree. As these examples suggest,
much of what we pretheoretically call science fiction is really a species of
horror, substituting futuristic technologies for supernatural forces. This is
not to say that all science fiction is a subcategory of horror, but only that
much is. Thus, in my examples, we will freely move between what is called
horror and what is called science fiction, regarding the boundary between
these putative genres as quite fluid.
I plan to analyze horror as a genre. However, it should not be assumed
that all genres can be analyzed in the same way. Westerns, for example, are
identified primarily by virtue of their setting. Novels, films, plays, paintings,
and other works, that are grouped under the label “horror” are identified
according to a different sort of criteria. Like suspense novels or mystery
novels, novels are denominated horrific in respect of their intended capacity
to raise a certain affect. Indeed, the genres of suspense, mystery, and horror
derive their very names from the affects they are intended to promote—a
sense of suspense, a sense of mystery, and a sense of horror. The cross-art,
cross-media genre of horror takes its title from the emotion it
characteristically or rather ideally promotes; this emotion constitutes the
identifying mark of horror.
Again, it must be underlined that not all genres are identified in this way.
The musical, either on stage or on film, is not tied to any affect. One might
think that musicals are by nature light and charming, in the fashion of Me
The Definition of Horror / 15
and My Girl. But, of course, this is not the case. Musicals can pretend to
tragedy (West Side Story, Pequod, Camelot), melodrama (Les Miserables),
worldliness (A Chorus Line), pessimism (Candide), political indignation
(Sarafina!), and even terror (Sweeney Todd). A musical is defined by a
certain proportion of song and perhaps usually dance and can indulge any
sort of emotion, the implicit argument of The Band Wagon (that it is
always entertaining) notwithstanding. The horror genre, however, is
essentially linked with a particular affect—specifically, that from which it
takes its name.
The genres that are named by the very affect they are designed to provoke
suggest a particularly tantalizing strategy through which to pursue their
analysis. Like works of suspense, works of horror are designed to elicit a
certain kind of affect. I shall presume that this is an emotional state, which
emotion I call art-horror. Thus, one can expect to locate the genre of horror,
in part, by a specification of art-horror, that is, the emotion works of this
type are designed to engender. Members of the horror genre will be identified
as narratives and/or images (in the case of fine art, film, etc.) predicated on
raising the affect of horror in audiences. Such an analysis, of course, is not a
priori. It is an attempt, in the tradition of Aristotle’s Poetics, to provide
clarificatory generalizations about a body of work that, in everyday
discourse, we antecedently accept as constituting a family.
Initially, it is tempting to follow the lead of the defenders of science
fiction and to differentiate the horror genre from others by saying that
horror novels, stories, films, plays, and so on are marked by the presence of
monsters. For our purposes, the monsters can be of either a supernatural or
a sci-fi origin. This method of proceeding distinguishes horror from what
are sometimes called tales of terror such as William Maginn’s “The Man in
the Bell,” Poe’s “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and “The Telltale Heart,”
Bloch’s Psycho, Tryon’s The Other, Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom, and
Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy, all of which, though eerie and unnerving,
achieve their frightening effects by exploring psychological phenomena
that are all too human. Correlating horror with the presence of monsters
gives us a neat way of distinguishing it from terror, especially of the sort
rooted in tales of abnormal psychologies. Similarly, by using monsters or
other supernatural (or sci-fi) entities as a criterion of horror, one can
separate horror stories from Gothic exercises such as Radcliffe’s Mysteries
of Udolpho, or from Charles Brockden Brown’s Wieland, or the
Transformation, or from Washington Irving’s “The Spectre Bridegroom,”
or from thirties’ shudder pulps such as the stories found in Weird Tales
where suggestions of other-worldly beings were often introduced only to be
explained away naturalistically.5 Likewise the theatrical genre of the
Grand Guignol, comprising works like Andre De Lorde’s The System of
Dr. Goudron and Professor Plume,6 will not figure as horror on this
16 / The Nature of Horror
accounting; for though gruesome, Grand Guignol requires sadists rather
than monsters.
However, even if a case can be made that a monster or a monstrous entity
is a necessary condition for horror, such a criterion would not be a sufficient
condition. For monsters inhabit all sorts of stories—such as fairy tales, myths
and odysseys—that we are not inclined to identify as horror. If we are to
exploit usefully the hint that monsters are central to horror, we will have to
find a way to distinguish the horror story from mere stories with monsters in
them, such as fairy tales.
What appears to demarcate the horror story from mere stories with
monsters, such as myths, is the attitude of characters in the story to the
monsters they encounter. In works of horror, the humans regard the
monsters they meet as abnormal, as disturbances of the natural order. In
fairy tales, on the other hand, monsters are part of the everyday furniture of
the universe. For example, in “The Three Princesses of Whiteland,” in the
Andrew Lang collection, a lad is beset by a three-headed troll; however, the
writing does not signal that he finds this particular creature any more
unusual than the lions he had passed earlier. A creature like Chewbacca in
the space opera Star Wars is just one of the guys, though a creature gotten up
in the same wolf outfit, in a film like The Howling, would be regarded with
utter revulsion by the human characters in that fiction.7
Boreads, griffins, chimeras, baselisks, dragons, satyrs, and such are
bothersome and fearsome creatures in the world of myths, but they are not
unnatural; they can be accommodated by the metaphysics of the cosmology
that produced them. The monsters of horror, however, breach the norms of
ontological propriety presumed by the positive human characters in the
story. That is, in examples of horror, it would appear that the monster is an
extraordinary character in our ordinary world, whereas in fairy tales and the
like the monster is an ordinary creature in an extraordinary world. And the
extraordinariness of that world—its distance from our own—is often
signaled by formulas such as “once upon a time.”
In his classic study The Fantastic,8
 Tzvetan Todorov classifies the worlds
of myths and fairy tales under the heading of “the marvelous.” Such realms
do not abide by scientific laws as we know them but have their own laws.
However, though I admire Todorov’s work and though I am obviously
influenced by it, I have not adopted his categories because I want to draw a
distinction within the category of supernatural tales between those that
indulge art-horror and those that don’t. Undoubtedly, Todorov and his
followers9
 would attempt to get at this distinction by means of the notion of
the fantastic/marvelous—stories that entertain naturalistic explanations of
abnormal incidents but conclude by affirming their supernatural origin.
Horror, it might be argued, falls under the label of the fantastic-marvelous.
However, though this might be right as far as it goes, it does not go far
The Definition of Horror / 17
enough. For the category of the fantastic-marvelous is not tight enough to
give us an adequate picture of art-horror. A film such as Close Encounters of
the Third Kind fits into the classification of fantastic-marvelous but is
beatific rather than horrific.10 The concept of the fantastic-marvelous, that
is, doesn’t zoom in on the particular affect that the horror genre is predicated
upon. Even if horror belongs to the genus of the fantastic-marvelous, it
constitutes a distinctive species. And it is that species with which we are
concerned.
As I have suggested, one indicator of that which differentiates works of
horror proper from monster stories in general is the affective responses of the
positive human characters in the stories to the monsters that beleaguer them.
Moreover, though we have only spoken about the emotions of characters in
horror stories, nevertheless, the preceding hypothesis is useful for getting at
the emotional responses that works of horror are designed to elicit from
audiences. For horror appears to be one of those genres in which the emotive
responses of the audience, ideally, run parallel to the emotions of characters.
Indeed, in works of horror the responses of characters often seem to cue the
emotional responses of the audiences.11
In “Jonathan Harker’s Journal,” in Dracula, we read:
As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which do what I would, I could
not conceal.
This shudder, this recoil at the vampire’s touch, this feeling of nausea all
structure our emotional reception of the ensuing descriptions of Dracula;
for example, when his protruding teeth are mentioned we regard them as
shudder-inducing, nauseating, rank—not something one would want
either to touch or be touched by. Similarly, in films we model our
emotional response upon ones like that of the young, blonde woman in
Night of the Living Dead, who, when surrounded by zombies, screams
and clutches herself in such a way as to avoid contact with the
contaminated flesh. The characters in works of horror exemplify for us
the way in which to react to the monsters in the fiction. In film and
onstage, the characters shrink from the monsters, contracting themselves
in order to avoid the grip of the creature but also to avert an accidental
brush against this unclean being. This does not mean that we believe in the
existence of fictional monsters, as the characters in horror stories do, but
that we regard the description or depiction of them as unsettling virtue of
the same kind of qualities that revolt someone like Jonathan Harker in the
preceding quotation.
The emotional reactions of characters, then, provide a set of instructions or,
rather, examples about the way in which the audience is to respond to the
18 / The Nature of Horror
monsters in the fiction—that is, about the way we are meant to react to its
monstrous properties. In the classic film King Kong, for example, there is a scene
on the ship during the journey to Skull Island in which the fictional director, Carl
Denham, stages a screen test for Ann Darrow, the heroine of the film within the
film. The offscreen motivations that Denham supplies his starlet can be taken as
a set of instructions for the way both Ann Darrow and the audience are to react
to the first apparition of Kong. Denham says to Darrow:
Now you look higher. You’re amazed. Your eyes open wider. It’s horrible
Ann, but you can’t look away. There’s no chance for you, Ann—no
escape. You’re helpless, Ann, helpless. There’s just one chance. If you can
scream—but your throat’s paralyzed. Scream, Ann, cry. Perhaps if you
didn’t see it you could scream. Throw your arms across your face and
scream, scream for your life.
In horror fictions, the emotions of the audience are supposed to mirror
those of the positive human characters in certain, but not all, respects. In the
preceding examples the characters’ responses counsel us that the
appropriate reactions to the monsters in question comprise shuddering,
nausea, shrinking, paralysis, screaming, and revulsion. Our responses are
meant, ideally, to parallel those of characters.12 Our responses are supposed
to converge (but not exactly duplicate) those of the characters; like the
characters we assess the monster as a horrifying sort of being (though unlike
the characters, we do not believe in its existence). This mirroring-effect,
moreover, is a key feature of the horror genre. For it is not the case for every
genre that the audience response is supposed to repeat certain of the
elements of the emotional state of characters.
If Aristotle is right about catharsis, for example, the emotional state of the
audience does not double that of King Oedipus at the end of the play of the
same name. Nor are we jealous, when Othello is. Also, when a comic
character takes a pratfall, he hardly feels joyous, though we do. And though
we feel suspense when the hero rushes to save the heroine tied to the railroad
tracks he cannot afford to indulge such an emotion. Nevertheless, with
horror, the situation is different. For in horror the emotions of the characters
and those of the audience are synchronized in certain pertinent respects,13 as
one can easily observe at a Saturday matinee in one’s local cinema.
That the audience’s emotional responses are modeled to a certain extent
on those of the characters in horror fictions provides us with a useful
methodological advantage in analyzing the emotion of art-horror. It suggests
a way in which we can formulate an objective, as opposed to an
introspective, picture of the emotion of art-horror. That is, rather than
characterizing arthorror solely on the basis of our own subjective responses,
we can ground our conjectures on observations of the way in which
characters respond to the monsters in works of horror. That is, if we proceed
The Definition of Horror / 19
under the assumption that our emotional responses as audience members are
supposed to parallel those of characters in important respects, then we can
begin to portray art-horror by noting the typical emotional features that
authors and directors attribute to characters molested by monsters.
How do characters respond to monsters in horror stories? Well, of course,
they’re frightened. After all, monsters are dangerous. But there is more to it
than this. In Mary Shelley’s famous novel, Victor Frankenstein recounts his
reaction to the first movements of his creation: “now that I had finished, the
beauty of the dream vanished and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure
the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, unable to
compose my mind to sleep.” Shortly after this, the monster, with an
outstretched hand, wakens Victor, who flees from its touch.
In “Sea-Raiders,” H.G.Wells, using the third person, narrates Mr. Frison’s
reaction to some unsavory, glistening, tentacled creatures: “he was horrified,
of course, and intensely excited and indignant at such revolting creatures
preying on human skin.” In Augustus Muir’s “The Reptile,” MacAndrew’s
first response to what he takes (wrongly) to be a giant snake is described as
the “paralysing grip of repulsion and surprise.”
When Miles, in Jack Finney’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers first
encounters the pods, he reports “At the feel of them on my skin, I lost my
mind completely, and then I was tramping them, smashing and crushing
them under my plunging feet and legs, not even knowing that I was uttering
a sort of hoarse meaningless cry—‘Unhh! Unhh! Unhh’—of fright and
animal disgust.” And in Peter Straub’s Ghost Story, Don makes love to the
monster Alma Mobley and suddenly senses “a shock of concentrated feeling,
a shock of revulsion—as though I had touched a slug.”
The theme of visceral revulsion is also evident in Bram Stoker’s
“Dracula’s Guest,” originally planned to be the first chapter of his seminal
vampire tale. The first-person narrator tells how he was awakened by what
commentators take to be a werewolf. He says:
This period of semi-lethargy seemed to remain a long time, and as it faded
away I must have slept or swooned. Then came a sort of loathing, like the
first stage of seasickness, and a wild desire to be free from something, I
know not what. A vast stillness enveloped me, as though the world were
asleep or dead—only broken by the low panting as of some animal close
to me. I felt a warm rasping at my throat, then came a consciousness of the
awful truth, which chilled me to the heart and sent the blood surging up
through my brain. Some great animal was lying on me and now licking my
throat.
Stevenson’s Mr. Hyde also evokes a powerful physical response. In the
report of his running down the little girl, Hyde is said to induce loathing
on sight. This is not simply a moral category, however, for it is connected
20 / The Nature of Horror
with his ugliness which is said to cause one to sweat. This bodily sense of
revulsion is further amplified when Enfield says of Hyde:
He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his
appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I
never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be
deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I
couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I
really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of
it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not for want of memory; for I declare I
can see him this moment.
Indescribability is also a key feature in Lovecraft’s “The Outsider.” The
narrator in this case is the monster himself; but the monster, a recluse
after the fashion of Kaspar Hauser, has no idea of what he looks like.
The situation is one in which he encounters a mirror without initially
realizing that the reflection is his own. And, he says:
As I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly; and
then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered—a ghastly ululation that
revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause—I beheld in full,
frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable
monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company
to a herd of delirious fugitives.
I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is
unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It was the
ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and desolation; the putrid, dripping
eidolon of unwholesome revelation; the awful baring of that which the
merciful earth should always hide. God knows it was not of this world—
or no longer of this world—yet to my horror I saw in its eaten away and
bone-revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty on the human shape;
and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that
chilled me even more.
I was paralysed, but not too much to make a feeble effort toward
flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the
nameless, voiceless monster held me. My eyes bewitched by the glassy
orbs which stared loathsomely into them, refused to close; though they
were mercifully blurred, and shewed the terrible object but indistinctly
after the first shock. I tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so
stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will. The
attempt, however, was enough to disturb my balance; so that I had to
stagger forward several steps to avoid falling. As I did so I became
suddenly and agonisingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing,
whose hideous hollow breathing I half fancied I could hear. Nearly mad, I
found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward off the foetid
apparition which pressed so close; when in one cataclysmic second of
cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accident my fingers touched the
rotting outstretched paw of the monster beneath the golden arch.
I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind
shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind
The Definition of Horror / 21
a single fleeting avalanche of soul-annihilating memory. I knew in that
second all that had been; I remembered beyond the frightful castle and the
trees, and recognized the altered edifice in which I now stood; I
recognized, most terrible of all, the unholy abomination that stood leering
before me as I withdrew my sullied fingers from its own.
Horrific creatures seem to be regarded not only as inconceivable but also
as unclean and disgusting. Frankenstein’s laboratory, for example, is
described as “a workshop of filthy creation.” And Clive Barker, the
literary equivalent of the splatter film, characterizes his monster, the son
of celluloid, in the story of the same name, thusly:
[Son of Celluloid]. “This is the body I once occupied, yes. His name was
Barberio. A criminal; nothing spectacular. He never aspired to greatness.”
[Birdy]. “And you?”
“His cancer. I’m the piece of him which did aspire, that did long to be
more than a humble cell. I am a dreaming disease. No wonder I love the
movies.”
The son of celluloid was weeping over the edge of the broken floor, its
true body exposed now it had no reason to fabricate a glory.
It was a filthy thing, a tumor grown fat on wasted passion. A parasite
with the shape of a slug, and the texture of raw liver. For a moment a
toothless mouth, badly molded, formed at its head end and said: “I’m
going to have to find a new way to eat your soul.”
It flopped into the crawlspace beside Birdy. Without its shimmering
coat of many technicolors it was the size of a small child. She backed away
as it stretched a sensor to touch her, but avoidance was a limited option.
The crawlspace was narrow, and further along it was blocked with what
looked to be broken chairs and discarded prayer books. There was no
way but the way she’d come, and that was fifteen feet above her head.
Tentatively, the cancer touched her foot, and she was sick. She couldn’t
help it, even though she was ashamed to be giving in to such primitive
responses. It revolted her as nothing ever had before; it brought to mind
something aborted, a bucket case.
“Go to hell,” she said to it, kicking at its head, but it kept coming, its
diarrheal mass trapping her legs. She could feel the churning motion of its
innards as it rose up to her.
More recently, Clive Barker has described the by-blows in Weaveworld
in these terms:
The thing lacked a body, its four arms springing straight from a bulbous
neck, beneath which clusters of sacs hung, wet as liver and lights. Cal’s
blow connected, and one of the sacs burst, releasing a sewer stench. With
the rest of the [by-blow] siblings close upon him, Cal raced for the door, but
the wounded creature was fastest in pursuit, sidling crablike on its hands,
and spitting as it came. A spray of saliva hit the wall close to Cal’s head,
and the paper blistered. Revulsion gave heat to his heels. He was at the door
in an instant.
22 / The Nature of Horror
Later it is said that the very thought of being touched by such creatures
is sickening.
Since horrific creatures are so physically repulsive, they often provoke
nausea in the characters who discover them. In Lovecraft’s “At the
Mountains of Madness,” the presence of the Shoggoths, giant, shapechanging,
black, excremental worms, is heralded by an odor which is
explicitly described as nauseating. In Black Ashes, by Noel Scanlon, touted
as “Ireland’s answer to Stephen King,”14 the investigative reporter Sally
Stevens vomits when the nefarious Swami Ramesh changes into the demon
Ravana who has been described as hideously and terrifyingly ugly, his face
blackened, his fingers talons, his teeth fanged, his tongue scaled and, in all,
giving off a smell of putrefaction.
Emotionally, these violations of nature are so fulsome and revolting that
they frequently produce in characters the conviction that mere physical
contact with them can be lethal. Consider the dream portent that Jack
Sawyer encounters in The Talisman by King and Straub:
some terrible creature had been coming for his mother—a dwarvish
monstrosity with misplaced eyes and rotting, cheesy skin. “Your mother’s
almost dead, Jack, can you say hallelujah?” this monstrosity had croaked,
and Jack knew—the way you knew things in dreams—that it was
radioactive, and that if it touched him he would die.
What examples like this (which can be multiplied endlessly) indicate is
that the character’s affective reaction to the monstrous in horror stories
is not merely a matter of fear, i.e., of being frightened by something that
threatens danger. Rather threat is compounded with revulsion, nausea,
and disgust. And this corresponds as well with the tendency in horror
novels and stories to describe monsters in terms of and to associate them
with filth, decay, deterioration, slime and so on. The monster in horror
fiction, that is, is not only lethal but—and this is of utmost
significance—also disgusting. Moreover, this combination of affect can
be quite explicit in the very language of horror stories; M.R. James
writes in “Canon Alberic’s Scrap-book” that “The feelings which this
horror stirred in Dennistoun were the intensest physical fear and the
most profound mental loathing.”15
The reports of characters’s internal reactions to monsters—whether from
a first-person, second-person (e.g., Carlos Fuentes’s Aura), or an authorial
point of view—correspond to the more behavioral reactions one can observe
in theater and cinema. Just before the monster is visualized to the audience,
we often see the characters shudder in disbelief, responding to this or that
violation of nature. Their faces contort; often their noses wrinkle and their
upper lip curls as if confronted by something noxious. They freeze in a
The Definition of Horror / 23
moment of recoil, transfixed, sometimes paralyzed. They start backwards in
a reflex of avoidance. Their hands may be drawn toward their bodies in an
act of protection but also of revulsion and disgust. Along with fear of severe
physical harm, there is an evident aversion to making physical contact with
the monster. Both fear and disgust are etched on the characters’ features.
Within the context of the horror narrative, the monsters are identified as
impure and unclean. They are putrid or moldering things, or they hail from
oozing places, or they are made of dead or rotting flesh, or chemical waste,
or are associated with vermin, disease, or crawling things. They are not
only quite dangerous but they also make one’s skin creep. Characters
regard them not only with fear but with loathing, with a combination of
terror and disgust.
In the attempted-abduction scene in James Whale’s movie version of
Frankenstein, we see—in the background of a medium shot—the monster
steal into the bedroom behind Dr. Frankenstein’s prospective bride. As she
paces to a door screen-right the monster follows her. Suspense builds. The
monster growls. As she turns, the camera cuts in for a close-up. She raises
her hand nearly to her eye and shrieks. The gesture suggests both an
attempt to cover her eyes and a withdrawal of her hand from the vicinity of
the monster, both in order to assure that he will neither grab it nor that she
will touch him. After a close-up of the monster, we return again to this
shot, which then yields to a medium shot where the bride backs away from
the monster and toward the camera. She gathers her dress toward herself as
she shrinks from the creature. Clearly, this is, in part, done so that the
monster will not step on the train of the dress. But at the same time, it
reinforces the feeling of her nearly hysterical desire to avoid contact with
the creature. At the end of the sequence, Dr. Frankenstein and his
confederates find the bride; apparently, she has fainted and is in some kind
of delirium, signaled both gesturally and verbally. The very sight of the
monster seems to have deranged her temporarily.
For an example from theater, we realize at the end of the second act of The
Dybbuk, by S.Anski, that the bride, Leye, is possessed by a dybbuk. A frail
(she’s been fasting) virgin, she suddenly speaks in a strange masculine voice.
The moment is one of horror—the presentation of a compound sexual
being—and now de rigeur in possession films (such as in The Exorcist where
the girlchild Regan speaks with the deep and aged voice of the demon).
According to the stage instructions in the text, the character who
approaches this unnatural composite is supposed to do so while shuddering.
To shudder, of course, is to suffer a convulsive tremor. But, more specifically,
it is to shake as a result of extreme cold, or fear, or repugnance and disgust.
Since the climate is irrelevant at this point in the play, the gesture is not to be
read as a response to the weather. Rather, the shuddering of the character,
which cues or at least reinforces the audience’s response, is connected with
24 / The Nature of Horror
abhorrence and fear. That is, the actor’s body is meant to tremble in such a
way that the quivering communicates extreme disgust as well as dread.
On the Structure of the Emotions
From this preliminary inventory of examples, it is possible to derive a
theory of the nature of the emotion of art-horror. But before setting out
that theory in detail, some comments need to be made about the
structure of emotions. I am presupposing that art-horror is an emotion.16
It is the emotion that horror narratives and images are designed to elicit
from audiences. That is, “art-horror” names the emotion that the
creators of the genre have perennially sought to instill in their audiences,
though they, undoubtedly would be more disposed to call this emotion
“horror” rather than “art-horror.”
Furthermore, it is an emotion whose contours are reflected in the emotional
responses of the positive human characters to the monsters in works of horror.
I am also presuming that art-horror is an occurrent emotional state, like a flash
of anger, rather than a dispositional emotional state, such as undying envy.
An occurrent emotional state has both physical and cognitive dimensions.
Broadly speaking, the physical dimension of an emotion is a matter of felt
agitation. Specifically, the physical dimension is a sensation or a feeling. An
emotion, that is, involves some kind of stirring, perturbation, or arrest
physiologically registered by an increase in heartbeat, respiration, or the like.
The word “emotion” comes from the Latin “emovere” which combines the
notion of “to move” with the prefix for “out.” An emotion originally was a
moving out. To be in an emotional state involves the experience of a
transition or migration—a change of state, a moving out of a normal
physical state to an agitated one, one marked by inner movings. To be an
occurrent emotion,17 I want to claim, involves a physical state—a sense of a
physiological moving of some sort—a felt agitation or feeling sensation.
In respect to art-horror some of the regularly recurring sensations, or feltphysical
agitations, or automatic responses, or feelings are muscular
contractions, tension, cringing, shrinking, shuddering, recoiling, tingling,
frozenness, momentary arrests, chilling (hence, “spine-chilling”), paralysis,
trembling, nausea, a reflex of apprehension or physically heightened
alertness (a danger response), perhaps involuntary screaming, and so on.18
The word “horror” derives from the Latin “horrere”—to stand on end (as
hair standing on end) or to bristle—and the old French “orror”—to bristle or
to shudder. And though it need not be the case that our hair must literally
stand on end when we are art-horrified, it is important to stress that the
original conception of the word connected it with an abnormal (from the
subject’s point of view) physiological state of felt agitation.
In order to be in an emotional state, one must undergo some concomitant
The Definition of Horror / 25
physical agitation, registered as a sensation. You could not be said to be
angry unless your negative evaluation of the man standing on your foot were
accompanied by some physical state, like being “hot under the collar.” A
computer with a radar tracking system might be able to printout “Enemy
missiles are headed at this base.” But it could not be in the emotional state of
fear; it lacks, metaphorically speaking, the “fleshy” hardware for that. It
does not feel the agitations that go with fear of imminent destruction. If one
could imagine such a computer to be in any mental state, it would be a pure
cognitive state not an emotional one. For an emotional state requires a felt
physical dimension. Characters like the Vulcans in Star Trek are said to lack
emotions precisely because they do not undergo the physical perturbations
and feelings that humans experience along with their reactions of aversion
and approval.
However, though in order to qualify as an emotional state, a state must
correlate with some physical agitation, the specific emotional state one is in
is not determined by the kinds of physical agitations one is suffering. That is,
no specific physical state represents a necessary or sufficient condition for a
given emotional state. When I am angry, my blood runs cold, whereas when
you are angry, your blood boils. In order to be an emotional state some
physical agitation must obtain, though an emotional state will not be
identified by being associated with a unique physical state or even a unique
assortment of physical states.
What is being denied in the preceding paragraph is the notion that
emotions are identical with certain feeling states or feeling qualities—that
anger, for example, is a certain feeling, a physical agitation with a
perceptibly distinctive sensation or quality. Just as we are thought to identify
something as sweet by virtue of the uniquely discernible sensation it
occasions, on the view rival to our own, anger has a uniquely discernible
quality, a flavor, if you will, whose very feel or taste enables us to recognize
we are angry. Call this approach the qualia or feeling view of the emotions.19
But this approach is surely insupportable.
When I’m afraid my knees shake with a tingling sensation while when
Lenny is afraid his mouth feels dry. And to complicate matters, when
crestfallen my mouth goes dry while Lenny has that tingling sensation in his
knees. Nancy, on the other hand, has a dry mouth and wobbly legs whenever
she feels grateful. These different feelings, that is, can be correlated with
different emotional states in different people. Indeed, these feelings might
occur when the subject is not in an emotional state at all. We could
administer a drug to someone, perhaps even to Nancy, which would render
her mouth dry and her legs wobbly. But I doubt that we would be willing in
those circumstances to say that Nancy is grateful. For as we’ve stated the
case, to whom is she grateful and for what?20
Moreover, it should be evident that the feelings that accompany emotions
26 / The Nature of Horror
not only vary from person to person, but also may vary within a single
subject on different occasions. The last time I was frightened my muscles
tightened but the time before that my muscles went limp. The qualia view of
the emotions appears to entail that when I am in an emotional state I need
only look inward to determine which emotional state I am in by attending to
whatever pattern of feeling is dominant. However, this won’t work, because
the feelings that accompany given emotional states vary wildly, because a
given feeling may attend a great diversity of emotional states, and because I
might discern a familiar pattern of physical feeling where there is no
emotion. Indeed, if we restrict our introspection exclusively to matters of
inner movement, we are unlikely to attach our feelings, understood as
physical feelings, to any emotional states.21
No specifiable, recurring feeling or package of feelings can be worked into
neccessary or sufficient conditions for a given emotion. That is, to
summarize the above arguments, in order to be an emotional state some
physical agitation must obtain, though an emotional state will not be
identified by being associated with a unique physical feeling state or even a
uniquely recurring pattern of physical feelings.
What then identifies or individuates given emotional states? Their
cognitive elements. Emotions involve not only physical perturbations but
beliefs and thoughts, beliefs and thoughts about the properties of objects and
situations. Moreover, these beliefs (and thoughts22) are not just factual—e.g.,
there is a large truck coming at me—but also evaluative—e.g., that large
truck is dangerous to me. Now when I am in a state of fear with regard to
this truck, I am in some physical state—perhaps I involuntarily squeeze my
eyes shut while my pulse shoots up—and this physical state has been caused
by my cognitive state, by my beliefs (or thoughts) that the truck is headed at
me and that this situation is dangerous. My eyes closing and my pulse racing
could be associated with many emotional states, e.g., ecstasy; what makes
my emotional state fear in this particular case are my beliefs. That is,
cognitive states differentiate one emotion from another though for a state to
be an emotional one there must also be some kind of physical agitation that
has been engendered by the presiding cognitive state (comprised of either
beliefs or thoughts).
To illustrate the point here, it may be helpful to indulge in a sciencefictionlike
thought experiment. Imagine that we have advanced to the point where
we can stimulate any sort of physical agitation by applying electrodes to the
brain. A scientist observing me nearly run over by the truck in the preceding
paragraph notes that when fearful my eyes clamp shut by reflex and my
pulse quickens. She then arranges her electrodes in my brain so as to raise
these physical states in me. Would we wish to say that, under these
laboratory conditions, I am afraid. I suspect not. And the theory outlined
above explains why not. For in the laboratory, my physical states are caused
The Definition of Horror / 27
by electrical stimulation; they are not caused by beliefs (or thoughts) and,
specifically, they are not caused by the kinds of beliefs that are appropriate to
the emotional state of fear.23
We can summarize this view of the emotions—which might be called a
cognitive/evaluative theory—by saying that an occurrent emotional state is
one in which some physically abnormal state of felt agitation has been
caused by the subject’s cognitive construal and evaluation of his/her
situation.24 This is the core of an emotional state, though some emotions may
involve wants and desires as well as construals and appraisals. If I am afraid
of the approaching truck, then I form the desire to avoid its onslaught. Here
the connection between the appraisal element of my emotion and my desire
is a rational one, since the appraisal provides a good reason for the want or
the desire. However, it is not the case that every emotion links up with a
desire; I may be saddened by the realization that I will die some day without
that leading to any other desire, such as, for instance, that I shall never die.
Thus, though wants and desires may figure in the characterization of some
emotions, the core structure of emotions involves physical agitations caused
by the construals and evaluations that serve constitutively to identify the
emotion as the specific emotion it is.
Defining Art-Horror
Using this account of the emotions, we are now in a position to organize
these observations about the emotion of art-horror. Assuming that “Iasaudience-member”
am in an analogous emotional state to that which
fictional characters beset by monsters are described to be in, then: I am
occurrently art-horrified by some monster X, say Dracula, if and only if
1) I am in some state of abnormal, physically felt agitation (shuddering,
tingling, screaming, etc.) which 2) has been caused by a) the thought:
that Dracula is a possible being; and by the evaluative thoughts: that b)
said Dracula has the property of being physically (and perhaps morally
and socially) threatening in the ways portrayed in the fiction and that c)
said Dracula has the property of being impure, where 3) such thoughts
are usually accompanied by the desire to avoid the touch of things like
Dracula.25
Of course, “Dracula,” here, is merely a heuristic device. Any old monster
X can be plugged into the formula. Moreover, in order to forestall charges of
circularity, let me note that, for our purposes, “monster” refers to any being
not believed to exist now according to contemporary science. Thus,
dinosaurs and nonhuman visitors from another galaxy are monsters under
this stipulation though the former once existed and the latter might exist.
Whether they are monsters who are also horrifying in the context of a
particular fiction depends upon whether they meet the conditions of the
28 / The Nature of Horror
analysis above. Some monsters may be only threatening rather than
horrifying, while others may be neither threatening nor horrifying.26
Another thing to note about the preceding definition is that it is the
evaluative components of the theory that primarily serve to individuate
arthorror. And, furthermore, it is crucial that two evaluative components
come into play: that the monster is regarded as threatening and impure. If
the monster were only evaluated as potentially threatening, the emotion
would be fear; if only potentially impure, the emotion would be disgust.
Arthorror requires evaluation both in terms of threat and disgust.
The threat component of the analysis derives from the fact that the
monsters we find in horror stories are uniformly dangerous or at least appear
to be so; when they cease to be threatening, they cease to be horrifying. The
impurity clause in the definition is postulated as a result of noting the
regularity with which literary descriptions of the experiences of horror
undergone by fictional characters include reference to disgust, repugnance,
nausea, physical loathing, shuddering, revulsion, abhorrence, abomination,
and so on. Likewise, the gestures actors on stage and on screen adopt when
confronting horrific monsters communicate corresponding mental states.
And, of course, these reactions—abomination, nausea, shuddering,
revulsion, disgust, etc.—are characteristically the product of perceiving
something to be noxious or impure.27 (With regard to the impurity clause of
this theory, it is persuasive to recall that horrific beings are often associated
with contamination—sicknesses, disease, and plague—and often
accompanied by infectious vermin—rats, insects and the like.)
It should also be mentioned that though the third criterion about the
desire to avoid physical contact—which may be rooted in the fear of
funestation—seems generally accurate, it might be better to consider it to be
an extremely frequent but not necessary ingredient of art-horror.28 This
caveat is included in my definition by means of the qualification “usually.”
In my definition of horror, the evaluative criteria—of dangerousness and
impurity—constitute what in certain idioms are called the formal object of
the emotion.29 The formal object of the emotion is the evaluative category
that circumscribes the kind of particular object the emotion can focus upon.
To be an object of art-horror, in other words, is limited to particular objects,
such as Dracula, that are threatening and impure. The formal object or
evaluative category of the emotion constrains the range of particular objects
upon which the emotion can be focused. An emotion involves, among other
things, an appraisal of particular objects along the dimensions specified by
the emotion’s operative evaluative category. Where a particular object is not
assessable in terms of the evaluative category appropriate to a given
emotion, the emotion, by definition, cannot be focused on said object. That
is, I cannot be art-horrified by an entity that I do not think is threatening and
impure. I may be in some emotional state with respect to this entity, but it is
The Definition of Horror / 29
not art-horror. Thus, the formal object or evaluative category of the emotion
is part of the concept of the emotion. Though the relation of the evaluative
category to the accompanying felt physical agitation is causal, the relation of
the evaluative category to the emotion is constitutive and, therefore,
noncontingent. It is in this sense that one might say that the emotion is
individuated by its object, i.e., by its formal object. Art-horror is primarily
identified in virtue of danger and impurity.
The evaluative category selects or focuses upon particular objects. The
emotion is directed toward such objects; art-horror is directed at particular
objects like Dracula, the Wolfman, and Mr. Hyde. The root of the term
“emotion,” as we noted above, comes from the Latin for moving out.
Perhaps, we can read that playfully and suggest that an emotion is an inner
moving (a physical agitation) directed outward (toward) a particular object
under the prompting and guidance of an appropriate evaluative category.
Much of the next chapter will be concerned with the ontological status of
the particular objects of art-horror. However, by way of preview, some
comment may be helpful now. The problem with discussing the particular
object of the emotion of art-horror is that it is a fictive being. Consequently,
we cannot construe “particular object” here to mean something like a
material being with specifiable space-time co-ordinates. The Dracula who
arthorrifies us doesn’t have specifiable space-time co-ordinates; he doesn’t
exist. So what kind of particular object is he?
Though this will be clarified and qualified in the next chapter, for the time
being let us say that the particular object of art-horror—Dracula, if you
will—is a thought. Saying that we are art-horrified by Dracula means that
we are horrified by the thought of Dracula where the thought of such a
possible being does not commit us to a belief in his existence. Here, the
thought of Dracula, the particular object that art-horrifies me, is not the
actual event of my thinking of Dracula but the content of the thought, viz.,
that Dracula, a threatening and impure being of such and such dimensions,
might exist and do these terrible things. Dracula, the thought, is the concept of
a certain possible being.30 Of course, I come to think about this concept
because a given book, or film, or picture invites me to entertain the thought of
Dracula, that is, to consider the concept of a certain possible being, viz.,
Dracula. From such representations of the concept of Dracula, we recognize
Dracula to be a threatening and impure prospect, one which gives rise to the
emotion of art-horror.
In Descartes’s “Third Meditation,” he draws the distinction between
what he calls objective reality and formal reality. The objective reality of a
being is the idea of the thing sans a commitment to its existence. We can
think of a unicorn without thinking that unicorns exist. That is, we can have
the idea or concept of a unicorn—i.e., a horse with a narwhal horn—without
thinking that that concept applies to anything. A being that has formal
30 / The Nature of Horror
reality exists; that is, its idea is instantiated by something that exists. In this
mode of speech, Dracula might be said to have objective reality but not
formal reality. Twisting Descartes’s vocabulary somewhat, we can say that
the particular objects of art-horror, our Draculas, are objective realities (but
not formal realities).
The use of the notion of impurity in this theory has caused misgivings in
two different directions. Commentators, hearing my lectures on this theory,
have worried that it is too subjective (in the contemporary rather than the
Cartesian sense above), on the one hand, and too vague on the other. In the
remainder of this section, I will take up these objections.
The charge of subjectivity involves the fear that the emphasis on disgust in
the theory is really a matter of projection. It goes something like this: Carroll
is a delicate sort of guy whose toilet training was probably traumatic. He
hasn’t actually done any empirical research into the reception of works of
horror by audiences. He doesn’t know that they find horrific monsters
disgusting and impure. At best, he’s identified his own reaction by introspection
and projected it onto everyone else.
However, the method that I have adopted to isolate the ingredients of
arthorror is designed to blunt charges of projection. I am interested in the
emotional response that horror is supposed to elicit. I have approached this
issue by assuming that the audience’s responses to the monsters in works of
horror are ideally intended to run parallel to and often to be cued by the
emotional responses of the relevant fictional characters to monsters. This
presupposition, in turn, enables us to look to works of horror themselves for
evidence of the emotional response they want to engender. I have not
depended on introspection in fastening on disgust and impurity as part of the
emotion of art-horror. Rather, I found expressions and gestures of disgust as
a regularly recurring feature of characters’s reactions in horror fictions.
It is true that I have not done any audience research. Nevertheless, that
does not entail that the theory has no empirical base. Rather, the empirical
base is comprised of the many stories, dramas, films, etc., that I reviewed in
order to track how fictional characters react to the monsters they encounter.
I believe that my hypotheses about art-horror can be confirmed by, for
example, turning to the descriptions of character reactions to the monsters in
horror novels and checking them for the recurring reference to fear and
disgust (or the strong implication of fear and disgust).
Whether art-horror is supposed to involve impurity, then, can be
corroborated by scanning works of horror in order to see whether or not
disgust and suggestions of impurity are regularly recurring features.
Moreover, there may be another way to bolster the claims of my theory. For
the theory, as stated above and in terms of some of the structures to be
discussed below, can be used to create horrific effects. That is, one can use
this theory as a recipe for making horrific creatures. The theory, of course, is
The Definition of Horror / 31
not an algorithm that guarantees success by the blind application of rules.
But it can be used to guide the construction of fictive beings of the sort that
most of us would agree are horrific. The capacity of the theory to facilitate
simulations of horror, then, may argue for the sufficiency of the theory.
Again, the object of my study concerns the emotional response that works
of art-horror are supposed to elicit. This is neither to claim that all works of
horror succeed in this matter—Robot Monster, for example, borders on the
ridiculous—nor that every audience member will report that they are
horrified—one can imagine macho teenagers denying that monsters disgust
them, claiming instead that they are amused. I am not preoccupied with the
actual relations of works of art-horror to audiences, but with a normative
relation, the response the audience is supposed to have to the work of
arthorror. I believe that we are able to get at this by presuming that the work
of art-horror has built into it, so to speak, a set of instructions about the
appropriate way the audience is to respond to it. These instructions are
manifested, by example, in the responses of the positive, human characters
to the monsters in horror fiction. We learn what is to be art-horrified in large
measure from the fiction itself; indeed, the very criteria for what it is to be
art-horrified can be found in the fiction in the description or enactment of
the human character’s responses. Works of horror, that is, teach us, in large
measure, the appropriate way to respond to them.31 Unearthing those cues or
instructions is an empirical matter, not an exercise in subjective projection.
Even if I can avoid the charge of projection, it might still be argued that
the notion of impurity employed in my definition of art-horror is too vague.
If a work of horror does not explicitly attribute “impurity” to a monster,
how can we be satisfied that the monster is regarded to be impure in the text?
The concept of impurity is just too fuzzy to be of use.
But perhaps I can relieve some of these anxieties concerning vagueness by
saying something about the kinds of objects that standardly give rise to or
cause reactions of impurity. This, moreover, will enable me to expand my
theory of art-horror from the realm of definition to that of explanation, from
an analysis of the application of the concept of art-horror to an analysis of its
causation.
In her classic study Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas correlates reactions
of impurity with the transgression or violation of schemes of cultural
categorization.32 In her interpretation of the abominations of Leviticus, for
example, she hypothesizes that the reason crawling things from the sea, like
lobsters, are regarded as impure is that crawling was a defining feature of
earthbound creatures, not of creatures of the sea. A lobster, in other words, is
a kind of category mistake and, hence, impure. Similarly, all winged insects
with four legs are abominated because though four legs is a feature of land
animals, these things fly, i.e., they inhabit the air. Things that are interstitial,
that cross the boundaries of the deep categories of a culture’s conceptual
32 / The Nature of Horror
scheme, are impure, according to Douglas. Feces, insofar as they figure
ambiguously in terms of categorical oppositions such as me/not me, inside/
outside, and living/dead, serve as ready candidates for abhorrence as impure,
as do spittle, blood, tears, sweat, hair clippings, vomit, nail clippings, pieces
of flesh, and so on. Douglas notes that among the people called the Lele,
flying squirrels are avoided since they cannot be categorized unambiguously
as either birds or animals.
Also, objects can raise categorical misgivings by virtue of being
incomplete representatives of their class, such as rotting and disintegrating
things, as well as by virtue of being formless, for example, dirt. 33
Following Douglas, then, I initially speculate that an object or being is
impure if it is categorically interstitial, categorically contradictory,
incomplete, or formless.34 These features appear to form a suitable grouping
as prominent ways in which categorizing can be problematized. This list may
not be exhaustive, nor is it clear that its terms are mutually exclusive. But it
is certainly useful for analyzing the monsters of the horror genre. For they
are beings or creatures that specialize in formlessness, incompleteness,
categorical interstitiality, and categorical contradictoriness. Let a brief
inventory carry this point for the time being.
Many monsters of the horror genre are interstitial and/or contradictory in
terms of being both living and dead: ghosts, zombies, vampires, mummies,
the Frankenstein monster, Melmoth the Wanderer, and so on. Near relatives
to these are monstrous entities that conflate the animate and the inanimate:
haunted houses, with malevolent wills of their own, robots, and the car in
King’s Christine. Also many monsters confound different species:
werewolves, humanoid insects, humanoid reptiles, and the inhabitants of Dr.
Moreau’s island.35
Or, consider the conflation of species in these descriptions of the monster
in Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror”: “Bigger’n a barn…all made o’
squirmin ropes…hull thing sort o’ shaped like a hen’s egg bigger’n anything,
with dozens o’ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step…nothin’
solid abaout it—all like jelly, an’ made o’ sep’rit wrigglin’ ropes pushed clost
together…great bulgin’ eyes all over it…ten or twenty maouths or trunks astickn’
aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an’a-tossin’ an’ openin’ an’
shuttin’…all, with kinder blue or purple rings…an’ Gawd in Heaven—that
haff face on top!….” And: “Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face—that haff face
on top of it…that face with the red eyes an’ crinkly albino hair, an’ no chin,
like the Whateleys…. It was a octopus, centipede, spider kindo’ thing, but
they was a haff-shaped man’s face on top of it, an’ it looked like Wizard
Whateley’s, only it was yards an’yards acrost….”
The creature in Howard Hawks’s classic The Thing is an intelligent,
twolegged, bloodsucking carrot. Now that’s interstitial. Indeed, the frequent
resort to referring to monsters by means of pronouns like “It” and “Them”
The Definition of Horror / 33
suggests that these creatures are not classifiable according to our standing
categories.36 Moreover, this interpretation is also supported by the frequency
with which monsters in horror are said to be indescribable or inconceivable.
Recall our previous examples from Stevenson and Lovecraft, or movie titles
like The Creeping Unknown; while sometimes Frankenstein’s creation is
referred to as the “monster with no name.” Again, the point would appear to
be that these monsters fit neither the conceptual scheme of the characters
nor, more importantly, that of the reader.
Horrific monsters often involve the mixture of what is normally distinct.
Demonically possessed characters typically involve the superimposition of
two categorically distinct individuals, the possessee and the possessor, the
latter usually a demon, who, in turn, is often a categorically transgressive
figure (e.g., a goat-god). Stevenson’s most famous monster is two men, Jekyll
and Hyde, where Hyde is described as having a simian aspect which makes
him appear not quite human.37 Werewolves mix man and wolf, while shape
changers of other sorts compound humans with other species. The monster
in King’s It is a kind of categorically contradictory creature raised to a higher
power. For It is a monster that can change into any other monster, those
other monsters already being categorically transgressive. And, of course,
some monsters, like the scorpion big enough to eat Mexico City, are
magnifications of creatures and crawling things already ajudged impure and
interstitial in the culture.
Categorical incompleteness is also a standard feature of the monsters of
horror; ghosts and zombies frequently come without eyes, arms, legs, or skin,
or they are in some advanced state of disintegration. And, in a related vein,
detached body parts are serviceable monsters, severed heads and especially
hands, e.g., de Maupassant’s “The Hand” and “The Withered Hand,” Le
Fanu’s “The Narrative of a Ghost of a Hand,” Golding’s “The Call of the
Hand,” Conan Doyle’s “The Brown Hand,” Nerval’s “The Enchanted
Hand,” Dreiser’s “The Hand,” William Harvey’s “The Beast With Five
Fingers” and so on. A brain in a vat is the monster in the novel Donovan’s
Brain by Curt Siodmak, which has been adapted for the screen more than
once, while in the film Fiend Without a Face the monsters are brains that use
their spinal cords as tails.
The rate of recurrence with which the biologies of monsters are vaporous
or gelatinous attests to the applicability of the notion of formlessness to
horrific impurity while the writing style of certain horror authors, such as
Lovecraft, at times, and Straub, through their vague, suggestive, and often
inchoate descriptions of the monsters, leaves an impression of formlessness.
Indeed, many monsters are literally formless: the man-eating oil slick in
King’s short story “The Raft,” the malevolent entity in James Herbert’s The
Fog and The Dark, in Matthew Phipps Shiel’s The Purple Cloud, in Joseph
Payne Brennan’s novella “Slime,” in Kate Wilhelm’s and Ted Thomas’s The
34 / The Nature of Horror
Clone, and the monsters in movies like The Blob (both versions) and The
Stuff.38
Douglas’s observations, then, may help dispel some of the fuzziness of
the impurity clause of my definition of art-horror. They can be used to
supply paradigmatic examples for the application of the impurity clause as
well as rough guiding principles for isolating impurity—such as that of
categorical transgression. Furthermore, Douglas’s theory of impurity can
be used by scholars of horror to identify some of the pertinent features of
the monsters in the stories they study. That is, given a monster in a horror
story, the scholar can ask in what ways it is categorically interstitial,
contradictory (in Douglas’s sense), incomplete, and/or formless. These
features, moreover, provide a crucial part of the causal structure of the
reaction of impurity that operates in the raising of the emotion of arthorror.
They are part of what triggers it. This is not to say that we realize
that Dracula is, among other things, categorically interstitial and that we
then react, accordingly, with art-horror. Rather that monster X is
categorically interstitial causes a sense of impurity in us without our
necessarily being aware of precisely what causes that sense.39
In addition, the emphasis Douglas places on categorical schemes in the
analysis of impurity indicates a way for us to account for the recurrent
description of our impure monsters as “un-natural.” They are un-natural
relative to a culture’s conceptual scheme of nature. They do not fit the scheme;
they violate it. Thus, monsters are not only physically threatening; they are
cognitively threatening. They are threats to common knowledge.40
Undoubtedly, it is in virtue of this cognitive threat that not only are horrific
monsters referred to as impossible, but also that they tend to render those who
encounter them insane, mad, deranged, and so on.41 For such monsters are in a
certain sense challenges to the foundations of a culture’s way of thinking.
Douglas’s theory of impurity might also help us to answer a frequent
puzzle about horror. It is a remarkable fact about the creatures of horror that
very often they do not seem to be of sufficient strength to make a grown man
cower. A tettering zombie or a severed hand would appear incapable of
mustering enough force to overpower a co-ordinated six-year-old.
Nevertheless, they are presented as unstoppable, and this seems
psychologically acceptable to audiences. This might be explained by noting
Douglas’s claim that culturally impure objects are generally taken to be
invested with magical powers, and, as a result, are often employed in rituals.
Monsters in works of horror, by extension, then, may be similarly imbued
with awesome powers in virtue of their impurity.
It is also the case that the geography of horror stories generally situates the
origin of monsters in such places as lost continents and outer space. Or the
creature comes from under the sea or under the earth. That is, monsters are
The Definition of Horror / 35
native to places outside of and/or unknown to the human world. Or, the
creatures come from marginal, hidden, or abandoned sites: graveyards,
abandoned towers and castles, sewers, or old houses—that is, they belong to
environs outside of and unknown to ordinary social intercourse. Given the
theory of horror expounded above, it is tempting to interpret the geography of
horror as a figurative spatialization or literalization of the notion that what
horrifies is that which lies outside cultural categories and is, perforce,
unknown.42
The theory of art-horror that I am advancing has not been derived from a
set of deeper principles. The way to confirm it is to take the definition of the
nature of art-horror, and the partial typology of the structures that give rise
to the sense of impurity along with the fission/fusion model to be developed
below, and to see if they apply to the reactions we find to the monsters
indigenous to works of horror. In my own research, though admittedly
informal, these hypotheses, so far, have proved rewarding. Moreover, these
hypotheses seem worthwhile candidates for more rigorous attempts at
corroboration than I have the training to pursue; that is, perhaps the
definition could be tested by social psychologists. Furthermore, the
definition of horror, the discussion of impurity, and the fission/fusion model
might be used by authors, filmmakers, and other artists to generate horrific
images. The degree to which the theory provides a reliable guide to making
or simulating monsters would be a further test of its mettle.
Further Objections and Counterexamples to
the Definition of Art-Horror
I have hypothesized that art-horror is an emotional state wherein,
essentially, some nonordinary physical state of agitation is caused by the
thought of a monster, in terms of the details presented by a fiction or an
image, which thought also includes the recognition that the monster is
threatening and impure. The audience thinking of a monster is prompted
in this response by the responses of fictional human characters whose
actions they are attending to, and that audience, like said characters,
may also wish to avoid physical contact with such types of things as
monsters. Monsters, here, are identified as any being not now believed
to exist according to reigning scientific notions.
This account of art-horror obviously depends on a cognitive-evaluative
theory of the emotions. Such theories, of course, have been confronted by
counterexamples. For instance, it is said that we are in emotional states while
dancing and that this is a matter of rhythm and physiology rather than of
cognition and evaluation. I am disposed to think that if we are in an
emotional state when dancing, then that has to do with our evaluation of the
situation: our evaluation, for example, of what the dance stands for,
36 / The Nature of Horror
commemorates, or celebrates; or our evaluation of our bond with our
partner, or the larger community of dancers, or our audience, or our relation
with the accompanying musicians, or even with the music itself. Or the
evaluation might have to do with ourselves, with the joy that comes from
judging that we dance well, or from appreciating being co-ordinated and
active, i.e., recognizing the dance as a mark of our own well-being. That is, if
we are in an emotional state while dancing, it seems attributable to many
sorts of evaluative beliefs. Simply being in a rhythmically induced, trancelike
state, directed at no object, does not seem to me to be an emotional state.
However, even if I am wrong here, it does not seem that such
counterexamples show that there are no cognitive-evaluative states with
respect to emotions. If successful, they would only establish that not all
emotional states are cognitive-evaluative ones. This would leave room for
the possibility that some emotional states are of the cognitive-evaluative
sort. And, of course, I would hold that art-horror is one of these.
This move, though, invites the response that, like the putative dance
emotion, shock is a rhythmically induced, nonevaluative emotion, and that
art-horror is really a variety of shock. I would not want to deny that shock is
often involved in tandem with art-horror, especially in theater and cinema.
Just before the monster appears, the music shoots up, or there is a startling
noise, or we see an unexpected, fast movement start out from “nowhere.”
Consider the end of the first act of the non-horror play Deathtrap by Ira
Levin when the supposedly dead, aspiring writer bursts into the living room
and gives the wife a heart attack. We jump in our seats, and perhaps some
scream. If the fiction in question is of the horror genre, when we then
recognize the monster, that scream of shock gets extended and applied as a
scream of horror. This is a well-known scare tactic.
However, horror is not reducible to this sort of shock. For this technique is also
found in mysteries and thrillers (like Deathtrap) where we don’t feel horror at the
gunman who suddenly steps out of the dark. This variety of shock does not seem
to me to be an emotion at all, but rather a reflex, though, of course, it is a reflex
that is often linked with the provocation of art-horror by the artisans of monster
spectacles. And, anyway, it must also be stressed that one can feel art-horror
without being shocked in the reflex sense of the term.43
Some theorists attack the cognitive-evaluative approach to the emotions by
claiming that insofar as it requires an object, it cannot be a general theory of
the emotions, because there are some emotions, like neurasthenia, that do not
have objects. This is a challenge to the comprehensiveness of
cognitiveevaluative theories; however, again, even if the theory does not
accommodate every emotion, it may still apply to art-horror. To level the
objectless emotion theory at this characterization of horror would require
showing either that all emotions are objectless or that art-horror is. But no one
has done that yet.44
The Definition of Horror / 37
My position with respect to art-horror requires that the emotion be
focused upon monsters where those are understood to be creatures not
countenanced by contemporary science. But this may prompt some to say
that the theory is too narrow. Aren’t movies like Orca and the Jaws series,
and novels like Gaston Leroux’s The Phantom of the Opera and John
Farris’s Nightfall examples of art-horror? But do they have monsters in the
requisite sense? Sharks, even very big ones, exist in the case of the Jaws
movies, and the villains in the novels cited are humans even if they are
psychopaths, a phenomenon readily acknowledged by contemporary
science.
The problem with these types of counterexamples, which are legion, is
that though nominally the antagonists belong to our everyday world, their
presentation in the fictions they inhabit turn them effectively into fantastical
beings. Ostensibly whales, sharks, and men, they acquire powers and
attributes above and beyond what one would be willing to believe of living
creatures. Erik, a.k.a. the Phantom of the Opera, whose medical afflictions
ill-match his strenuous hyperactivity, also appears, at times, to have powers
of virtual invisibility and omniscience. He seems capable of being anywhere
at will. Of course, many fictional characters have exaggerated attributes. But
the exaggerated attributes of the Phantom are expressly played for
supernatural effect of the awe-inspiring variety. He is described as a ghost
and a corpse, and he carries off inexplicable feats that seem magical.
Likewise Angel, the psycho in Nightfall, is portrayed as an unstoppable,
mute, relentless force of nature. He is said to be inhuman. The character
Anita, his estranged wife, says: “Angel’s not that big, but then again he isn’t
really human. Just what he is, I don’t know.” Nor does Anita intend to say
that her husband, like so many others, is a monster metaphorically speaking;
she means people to take her literally. If one is tempted to categorize a novel
like Nightfall as horror, I think that it is because sentences like the one
quoted, together with descriptions of Angel’s willfulness, inscrutability, and
powers, rhetorically move us to regard Angel as an inhuman creature.
Similar observations can be made about creatures like Orca. This is a
whale that can track humans down, figure out the relation of gas and fuel
pumps, and on the basis of that inference and some other observations, burn
down a harbor. Likewise, the sharks in the Jaws series seem too smart and
innovative to be sharks, while, like Orca, the creature in the last installment
is capable of carrying out long term projects of revenge way beyond the
mental capacities of its species. Indeed, the shark in these films manages to
kill about as many humans in a single summer as all the actual sharks in the
world do in a year. These are not the creatures of marine biology but fantasy.
In general, where the antagonistic creatures in films and novels that we
are prone to classify as horror appear to be ostensibly on the list of presently
existing beings, a brief look at the manner of their presentation most often
38 / The Nature of Horror
quickly reveals they are preternatural: the killer bees in Curtis Harrington’s
film of the same name have made Gloria Swanson their queen, while the
vampire bats in Martin Cruz Smith’s novel Nightwing are connected to
apocalyptic Hopi legends and prophecies that the reader is supposed to take
seriously; in the concluding pages of that novel the burning bats and smoke
become a giant wraith which speaks to the hero Youngman.
On the other hand, the eponymous dog in King’s Cujo is just a dog, and this
leads me to think that the book, though not unrelated to horror, is not a
pedigreed example of the genre. Rather, it belongs to the more amorphous
categories of the thriller or of suspense. Of course, this is not a criticism of
King. For the concept of horror, as I am using it, is descriptive rather than
prescriptive.
However, even if I have succeeded above in deflecting the major types of
counterexamples, the very procedure of concocting a definition of art-horror
and testing it against counter-instances may seem dubious to many readers.
They might feel that art-horror is not the sort of thing that can be captured
by definitions in terms of sets of necessary and sufficient conditions. Insofar
as art-horror is a constructed kind, not a natural kind—an artistic genre
rather than a natural phenomenon—it may be argued that it is not
susceptible of the type of tight definition I propose. Rather it is a concept
with fuzzy and perhaps developing boundaries. It supports myriad border
cases that cannot be ruled in or out of the genre except by fiat.
Nevertheless, even if horror is such an open concept, exercises in framing
it in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions are still useful, especially in
understanding the genre. It may be true that a sharp line cannot be drawn
between art-horror and its neighbors because its boundaries are somewhat
fluid. But a theory such as the one proposed—based on extrapolations from
paradigm cases—may still enhance our grasp not only of horror itself, but
also of its contesting neighbors.45
For even if the proposed theory of horror is not invulnerably
comprehensive, it does offer at least a clear picture of the central or core
cases of art-horror. If there are contesting counter-cases that the theory does
not accommodate, the theory may yet be useful in illuminating those
examples by showing, in terms of the theory itself, how intuitions that these
counterinstances should count are motivated.
Consider the case of Hitchcock’s Psycho. One could imagine the claim
that it ought to be regarded as an example of horror. But, of course, my
theory does not count it as such, because Norman Bates is not a monster. He
is a schizophrenic, a type of being that science countenances (though only
self-deceptively, the film suggests). But there appear to be many reasons to
regard Psycho as a horror film. There is the imagery of the old dark house,
and the drama of corridors. The story is set in a lonely place, off the beaten
track, where the appearance of a single woman unleashes forces of sexual
The Definition of Horror / 39
assault, murder, and incest. As well, various of the narrative structures (e.g.,
the build-up to the final manifestation of the nefarious creature), the shock
tactics (sudden movements and Bernard Herrmann’s unnerving, shrieking
strings), the imagery (e. g., the skeleton), and even the lighting are suggestive
of horror films. With so many correspondences, am I not just standing on
ceremony in refusing to accept it as an example of horror?
Perhaps. But more interesting from the point of view of the informativeness
of my theory is the fact that on the basis of it, I can explain why it is that
viewers are so tempted to think of Psycho as a horror film. For even if Norman
Bates is not a monster technically speaking, he does begin to approximate the
central features of art-horror as I have developed them. That a madman with a
butcher knife is threatening needs no comment. But, as well, Norman Bates, in
virtue of his psychosis, resembles the impure beings at the core of the concept
of art-horror.
He is Nor-man: neither man nor woman but both. He is son and mother. He
is of the living and the dead. He is both victim and victimizer. He is two
persons in one. He is abnormal, that is, because he is interstitial. In Norman’s
case, this is a function of psychology rather than biology. Nevertheless, he is a
powerful icon of impurity, which is, ultimately, why I submit that
commentators are prone to classify Psycho as a horror film. By developing a
core theory of horror, consequently, we place ourselves in a position to identify
the crucial features of a figure like Norman Bates that lead people to align him
with the figures of horror. Whether in the long run we count Psycho as horror
may be a matter of decision. Nevertheless, by developing a definition of the
core cases of horror, we place ourselves in a position to explain what it is about
figures like Norman Bates that tempts people to classify him as horrific. That
is, possessing a core theory of horror has explanatory advantages.
The explanatory advantage of this core theory of horror can also be
illustrated by its ability to handle bizarre cases. A recent example is David
Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly, perhaps the gooiest version of the Beauty
and the Beast legend ever made. This film has all the trappings of a horror
film, including a monster. But classifying it as a horror film as such, without
qualification, seems not quite right. It fails to capture an essential difference
between this film and the rest of the genre. The theory of horror offered here
can explain that difference.
The fly figure in this film is undeniably impure. Not only is he a grotesque
man/insect; his behavior is disgusting. He digests food externally in a way
that resembles vomiting. He would appear to be the very paradigm of the
horrific object and yet for much of the film he is not. Why?
The horrific object is a compound of threat and impurity. However, for much
of the film the fly monster is not threatening. He has a girlfriend, who, as we
have argued, cues our response to the fly, and until the end of the film, at least,
she does not feel threatened by the fly. Rather, she remains concerned. Likewise,
40 / The Nature of Horror
for most of the film, the audience, via the agency of the girlfriend, emotionally
responds to the fly in terms of disgust tinged with sympathy and care. This does
change during the denouement when the fly becomes dangerous to all
concerned. But the curious affect that suffuses much of this film can be
pinpointed according to our theory by virtue of the way in which the creature is
presented as not horrific due to the girlfriend’s sense of security vis-à-vis the fly.
She is patently disgusted by his malady, as we are; but her concern for him leads
her to attempt to get past this, and I think the ideal audience does as well.46
One immensely successful, recent author whose work is sometimes classified
as horror is V.C. Andrews. Her books, like Flowers in the Attic, as well as its
sequels and prequels, concern hidden incest. Clearly, what is taken to be
unnatural here is unnatural and repulsive from a moral standpoint. From my
perspective, this is an extreme extension of genre, one I would be prone to reject.
But I think that many, who do not explicitly advocate a theory of art-horror like
the one offered here, would also be uncomfortable about including the Flowers
in the Attic series in the genre. A novel like John Coyne’s Hunting Season, on the
other hand, where the progeny of generations of incest are quite literally
monstrous and disgusting is a better candidate for inclusion in the genre.
I have examined the charge that my use of the concept of monsters in my
theory of horror is too narrow. But it might also be claimed that it is too
broad. If monsters are beings whose existence is denied by contemporary
science, then isn’t the comic book character Superman a monster? This
seems not only ungrateful, given everything Superman has done for us, but
also wrong if we think of monsters as beings so ugly as to frighten us, i.e., as
beings somehow grotesque. But Superman, on the contrary, could be thought
of as exemplifying certain ideals of male beauty.
But, of course, the sense of “monster” that I am using does not necessarily
involve notions of ugliness but rather the notion that the monster is a being in
violation of the natural order, where the perimeter of the natural order is
determined by contemporary science. Superman is not compossible with what
is known of the natural order by science. He may at a later date become so, as
knowledge of other planets and galaxies advances, but I wouldn’t bet on it.47
Strategically, I have taken monsters as a genus and then attempted to
identify horrifying monsters as a species therein, a species upon which the
emotion of art-horror focuses. I have taken the capacity to instill a sense of
danger and impurity to be that which differentiates horrifying monsters from
all other monsters. In this, care had to be exercised to make sure that the
differentiating features of horrifying monsters in fact differentiated them
from monsters in general. That is, I had to assure that the definition was not
circular in the sense that concepts like danger and impurity were already
built into the concept of the monster. My concept of monsters in general
must be independent of evaluations in terms of danger and impurity, if the
definition is to be effective. Thus, I opted for a conception of monsters as
The Definition of Horror / 41
beings that do not exist according to the lights of contemporary science.
Neither impurity or danger figure necessarily in this conception.
In construing monsters in this way, certain ordinary uses of the notion
have been ignored. For example, monsters need not be ugly or grotesque. But
two points need to be made here. First, ugliness does not seem to be a
necessary mark of monsters even in ordinary language. Dracula as played by
Frank Langella and the Wandering Jew in William Harrison Ainsworth’s
“The Spectre Bride” would appear to be quite handsome (monstrosity and
impurity may be more than skin-deep). Second, the notion that we employ—
of the monster as something outside the natural order (as dictated by
science)—is also in accord with the ordinary usage, and I suspect is even
more central than usage based on the outward aspect of beings.
Of course, the problems with cases like Superman are rendered even
more complex because monsters in everyday speech are often thought of in
terms of morality. A monster can be a being who is extremely cruel and/or
evil. And Superman is such a nice man. However, I think that for our
purposes we can regard this particular use of “monster” as a form of moral
condemnation which is basically metaphorical. For there are lots of
monsters who are good guys: E.T., Ariel, and The Swamp Thing in the D.C.
comic book serial.
Lastly, the emphasis on monsters throughout this discussion should make
it clear that my theory of art-horror is what might be called entitybased.
That is, my definition of horror involves essential reference to an entity, a
monster, which then serves as the particular object of the emotion of arthorror.
Notice, in other words, that I have not taken events to be among the
primary objects of art-horror.48
This may strike some readers as problematic. For if one picks up an
anthology of horror stories, one notes that some of the stories lack monsters,
impure or otherwise. Mysterious, unnerving, preternatural events instead
seem to be the object of the peculiar emotions that such stories appear
designed to provoke.
In Robert Louis Stevenson’s “The Body Snatcher,” there is no monster. The
emotional twist that comes at the end of the story arises when the two grave
robbers—Fettes and MacFarlane—realize that the corpse in the grave they
have just desecrated has, after a flash of darkness, turned into the corpse of
Gray, someone whom Fettes had dissected and whom Macfarlane had
probably murdered some time before. The unhinging appearance of Gray—
seeming to come out of nowhere—is a kind of supernatural revenge, a cosmic
pang of conscience, but it does not involve anything remotely resembling a
monster.
There are, of course, many stories like this: Guy de Maupassant’s “Who
Knows?,” in which the narrator’s furniture inexplicably disappears and
reappears; Richard Matheson’s “The Edge,” in which Donald Marshal,
42 / The Nature of Horror
gradually and with mounting anxiety, appears to learn that he is a
doppelganger from a parallel universe; David Morrell’s “Mumbo Jumbo”
where the reader is led step by skeptical step to the point at which one is
supposed to conclude that the pagan statue actually is the source of its
owner’s success. Many of the episodes on the old TV series The Twilight
Zone are of this sort. Often they are tricked out with O. Henry-type hooks.
They seem to prosper best in short forms. Their conclusions often correlate
with some sense of cosmic moral justice. But they need not. Such stories may
involve horrific beings—e.g., the son risen from the dead in W.W.Jacobs’s
classic “The Monkey’s Paw”; but in the main their energy is spent
constructing a psychologically disturbing event of preternatural origins.</p>
