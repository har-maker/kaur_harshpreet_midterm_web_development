<h4 style="color:#FFF;">Acknowledgments:</h4>
             <p class="fr">Undoubtedly, my parents, Hughie and Evelyn Carroll, inadvertently
gave birth to this treatise by telling me not to waste my time and money
on horror books, magazines, comics, TV shows, and movies. In a final
act of filial defiance, I, a middle-aged baby-boomer, have set out to
prove to them that I was gainfully employed all along.
My thinking about horror really began to assemble itself when Annette
Michelson and I taught a course in horror and science fiction at New York
University. Annette soldiered the science fiction half of the course, while the
gooier parts of the terrain became my lot. Annette was, and has continued to
be, very helpful in the development of my theory. She suggested casting my
notions about horrific biologies in terms of fusion and fission, and, as well,
she has continually pressed me, with regard to my skepticism about
contemporary film theory, to take the paradox of fiction seriously. Though
my solutions to her questions may not be what she expected, I hope they are
at least intriguing.
Early on, two philosophers—both of them horror addicts—abetted me in
the conviction that pursuing this topic could be interesting. Judith Tormey
and I spent an exhilarating drive to Mexico together, boring everyone else in
the car while we swapped favorite monster stories. Jeff Blustein read my
earliest attempts in horror theory with the analytical rigor and the
enthusiasm only a fellow horror buff can appreciate.
The late Monroe Beardsley also read my nascent efforts at horror theory.
He wondered aloud how I could be interested in this stuff. But then he
addressed my hypotheses with what could only be thought of as arcane
counterexamples. Sheepishly, he explained his estimable expertise in the field
by saying that he had had to squire his sons through the fifties horror movie
cycle, and that he just happened to remember some of the films (in amazing
detail, I would add).
My interest in horror gradually turned into academic papers, delivered at
the University of Southern California, the University of Warwick, the
Museum of the Moving Image, LeMoyne College, Cornell University, New
York University, and the University of Iowa. Each audience provided
challenging comments—of special note are those of: Stanley Cavell, Ed
Leites, Karen Hansen, Richard Koszarski, Johnny Buchsbaum, Stuart
Liebman, Allan Casebier, Jim Manley, Bruce Wilshire, Susan Bordo, the late
Irving Thalberg Jr., Stephen Melville, Mary Wiseman, Ken Olsen, Nick
Sturgeon, Anthony Appiah, David Bathrick, Cynthia Baughman, Murray
Smith, Dudley Andrew, Henry Jenkins, Kristin Thompson, Berenice
Reynaud, and Julian Hochberg.
Much of the initial writing of this book began during a sabbatical at
Wesleyan University. Early discussions with Kent Bendall—one of the most
precise and yet imaginatively open philosophers it has been my privilege to
know—gave me important clues for solving what I call the paradox of
fiction. Long talks with Chris Gauker, over several extremely pleasant
dinners, helped me clarify my position. Ken Taylor and especially Philip
Hallie, whose pioneering work on the philosophy of horror in his book The
Paradox Cruelty served as an exemplar, listened to my theories with a critical
attentiveness that was generous, and always supportive and instructive. Phil
was even willing to go to a number of movies with me and to discuss them
afterwards (something only someone who works on the genre of horror can
realize is a gesture of unstinting companionship).
Michael Denning, Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse provided
many useful suggestions about correspondences between my research and
contemporary literary studies. Betsy Traube, transcending her aversion to
my topic, made many pertinent recommendations about relevant
anthropological literature. Khachig Tololyan who, among his many
accomplishments, runs one of the world’s great clipping services, kept me
constantly on top of my subject. And Jay Wallace, who read drafts of the first
two chapters with immense care, supplied me with copious criticisms and
suggestions. On more than one occasion, Jay showed me how I could modify
my claims judiciously and still make my points. Both his unalloyed interest
and his arguments have made significant differences in this book. It was
wonderful to have been his colleague.
Francis Dauer, Annette Barnes, John Fisher, Dale Jamieson, George
Wilson, Arthur Danto, George Dickie, John Morreall, Richard Moran, Terry
Irwin, Laurent Stern, Paul Guyer, Alex Sesonske, Daniel Banes, Jennefer
Robinson, Susan Feagin, Gary Iseminger, Roy Gordon, and Myles Brand
listened to, or read my hypotheses, and made comments which I found
important to consider. Joe Margolis, across a number of conversations,
showed me the need to make several distinctions I had ignored, as well as
pointing me toward some authors of whose work I had been uninformed.
Richard Shusterman, after reading my essay “The Nature of Horror,”
<br/>
alerted me to Peter Lemarque’s seminal and more advanced writings on the
very type of theory of fictional objects that I was attempting to develop.
Tony Pipolo and Amy Taubin, both of whom see and read everything,
gave me “front-line” reports on every novel, film and video that I hoped to
accommodate in my theory. If their sensibilities outstrip my formulas, I hope
they can nevertheless see some of their sensitivities worked into my
descriptions.
David Bordwell, David Konstan, and Peter Kivy read the entire
manuscript. Each made provocative criticisms and useful suggestions. David
Bordwell showed me how I needed to clarify the distinction between my
theory and reigning psychoanalytic models in the humanities today, as well
as correcting some (there weren’t that many) of my film-historical errors.
David Konstan made sentence-by-sentence remarks, many of which I have
incorporated; those I have bypassed, I suspect, I have so done at my own
peril. Peter Kivy not only copy-edited the manuscript, but made many
penetrating philosophical comments about the content. However, above all,
it is to Peter that I owe, due to his work in the philosophy of music, the
insight of the applicability, in general, of the theory of the emotions to
questions in the philosophy of art.
Special thanks are due to William Germano who, it can be said, first had
the thought that such a book could be written. In the course of a
conversation on other matters, he indicated that he would “love” (his word)
a proposal for a book on the philosophy of horror from me. I would not have
thought of it otherwise. The rest is history (destiny?).
I have dedicated this book to my wife, Sally Banes. She courageously
accompanied me on my many forays to cinemas and theaters all over the
world for the sake of my “research.” She patiently waited while I perused
innumerable bookstalls any time we went to a grocery store, a pharmacy, or
a department store outlet. Her own work on the fairy tale also afforded me
an extremely useful complement to my theorizing about horror. Sally has
read every draft of this project and provided endless comment: grammatical
and logical; stylistic and conceptual. If such a book is a labor of love, it is also
a labor of lovers. And I have been blessed with a lover willing to make my
project her own.
So many smart and talented people have told me so much. If there are
flaws remaining in this text, it only shows that I’m a bad listener.</p> <br/>
